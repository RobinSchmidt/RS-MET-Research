The set A^B of all functions from B={0,1,2} to A={0,1} has A^B 2^3 = 8 entries:

    0  1  2

0   0  0  0
1   0  0  1
2   0  1  0
3   0  1  1 
4   1  0  0 
5   1  0  1 
6   1  1  0 
7   1  1  1 

Each row represents one possible function. The column index is the index into the domain B. We want
to compute the index into the codomain A, i.e. the matrix entry. Let k be the column index counted 
from the right, i.e. 0 for the rightmost column. The rightmost column increments (mod 2) every row,
the middle one every 2nd row and the leftmost one every 4th row. In general, it increments every 
(2^k)th row


The set A^B of all functions from B={0,1} to A={0,1,2} has A^B 3^2 = 9 entries:

    0  1

0   0  0
1   0  1
2   0  2
3   1  0
4   1  1
5   1  2
6   2  0
7   2  1
8   2  2

I think, in general, the increment occurs every N^k rows
