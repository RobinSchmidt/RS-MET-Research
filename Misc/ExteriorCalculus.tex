% the generalized Stokes theorem generalizes the curl theorem in two ways:
% (1) it can now be applied to (co)vector-fields in arbitrary dimensions
% (2) it cannot only be applied to vector fields but also scalar fields, bivector fields, etc. One tpyically does not look at vector fields per se but at 1-form fields (i.e. covector fields) instead (or, in general, at k-form fields). But they area isomorphic, so it's ok to identify them. however, in 3D, integrating a (co)bivector fields will yield a (co)vector fields, which is the vector potential of the original bivector field...wait ...does this co-bivector thing make sense? or *is* a bivector the same thing as a covector? yes, i think, in 3D a vector is identified with a 1-form and a bivector is identified with a 2-form which is also a covector
