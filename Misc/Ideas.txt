Representing math things on a computer:

RealNumber
-a real number is represented as an infinite series of rational numbers 
-the first few elements of the series are written down directly, the 
 potentially infinitely many others are specified in terms of a rule, how to
 compute the next element from previous ones
-so, the representation is finite (finite set of rationals + recursive rule)
-example e = 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... -> a_0 = 1, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1/2,
 a_n = a_{n-1}/n
-questions:
 -is this powerful enough to represent any real number?
 -how can real numbers defined like that be added, subtracted, multiplied
  and divided - what about roots, exponentiation, etc? will these operations 
  again yield a finite number of initial terms plus a recursive rule
 -how is the recursive rule represented? initial terms are added directly, 
  multiplication of initial terms will probably involve convolution, division
  deconvolution
 -maybe the rule can be expressed as an expression in a CAS
-figure out representations pi, e+pi, e*pi, e/pi, e^pi, maybe also the golden 
 ratio phi


IntervalSet:
-an interval is represented a pair of a minimum and maximum value together with
 flags whether min and max are included (2 reals, 2 bools)
-a set of intervals is represented as an array of intervals
-addition of IntervalSets represents the union, multiplication the intersection
-the arithmetic operators should detect overlapping intervals in a set and 
 merge them as appropriate, like (0,3] * [2,4) + (3,6] = [2,3] + (3,6] = [2,6] 
-the empty interval is the neutral element of addition (union) and canonically 
 represented as: min = max = 0, minIncluded = maxIncluded = false
-the inifinite interval is the neutral element of multiplication (intersection) and
 represented as: min = -inf, max = inf, minIncluded = maxIncluded = false (because
 infinity is never included in math - but it may not make a difference whether we
 include it or not)
-we may also define subtraction as the set-difference operation - but this 
 operation can't be expressed as addition of an inverse element because the set 
 union can make a set only larger, but this operation should make it smaller
-is there also an inverse operation to multiplication, i.e. intersection? maybe a 
 union with the complement? is (A * B) / B = A when * means intersection and / 
 means union-with-complement? -> figure out
-can we define addition differently such that there are inverse elements? 
 probably not
-can "equations" always be solved even though we do not have a field (because 
 of the lack of additive inverses)?
