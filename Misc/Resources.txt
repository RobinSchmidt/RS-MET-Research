maybe, it's possible to create demos with my own python module?
...see maybe see here:
https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/dockerfile.html
...maybe a postbuild step can just copy the rsPy module dll (or .so) filepath
into the environment? ...or maybe see here:
https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#can-i-add-executable-files-to-the-user-s-path
...maybe copy the pre-built (for linux, i guess) rsPy.so library into some directory 
as explained there and add that directory to the pythonpath. i think, the .so file 
should then be part of the repo - or we drag it in from rs-met.com
