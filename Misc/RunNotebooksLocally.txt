shift-rightclick and open command window in:

C:\Users\Rob\Anaconda3

or whereever your (Anaconda) python installation resides. Type:

conda list

to check, if the relevant packages are installed. For a missing package, in 
order to install it, use commands like:

conda install ipywidgets

if widgets don't work in the notebook, try:

conda install widgetsnbextension

and maybe enter:

jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension

in the command window (running in the Anaconda directory)

...that doesn't work - here:
https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html
it says to use:

jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix

instead. ...that doesn'T work either


(i think, "pip" instead of "conda" may also be used)


i get:
[IPKernelApp] ERREOR | No such comm target registered: jupyter.widget.version

and in the browser console:

Could not cross validate the widget frontend and backend versions.

that seems to be an important hint


...maybe i should try to do a fresh install of Anaconda? my installation is
quite old already....

trying to get it to work with sage:

when running the sage notebook server instead (installed in
C:\Users\Rob\AppData\Local\SageMath 8.4\), the widgets do appear and work

maybe we can start the sage server starting in the correct directory by passing
the directory as coomandline parameter as said here:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/NxN_oCasrkA
it is possible to start in the current directory with 
sage -notebook=ipython --notebook-dir=. 

https://ask.sagemath.org/question/9126/running-sage-with-files-on-dropbox/
https://ask.sagemath.org/question/10233/notebook-default-directory/


the target for the shortcut for launching a sage notebook is:
"C:\Users\Rob\AppData\Local\SageMath 8.4\runtime\bin\mintty.exe" -t 'SageMath 8.4 Notebook Server' -i sagemath.ico /bin/bash --login -c '/opt/sagemath-8.4/sage --notebook jupyter'
can we add something to that command to tell it to use a different directory?

-start mintty manually
-paste /bin/bash --login -c '/opt/sagemath-8.4/sage --notebook jupyter'
 ->starts the notebook server

sage --notebook=jupyter --notebook-dir=/home/foo/bar
sage --notebook=jupyter --notebook-dir=C:/

/bin/bash --login -c '/opt/sagemath-8.4/sage --notebook=jupyter --notebook-dir=C:/'
