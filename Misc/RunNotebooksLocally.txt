shift-rightclick and open command window in:

C:\Users\Rob\Anaconda3

or whereever your (Anaconda) python installation resides. Type:

conda list

to check, if the relevant packages are installed. For a missing package, in 
order to install it, use commands like:

conda install ipywidgets

(i think, "pip" instead of "conda" may also be used)
