shift-rightclick and open command window in:

C:\Users\Rob\Anaconda3

or whereever your (Anaconda) python installation resides. Type:

conda list

to check, if the relevant packages are installed. For a missing package, in 
order to install it, use commands like:

conda install ipywidgets

if widgets don't work in the notebook, try:

conda install widgetsnbextension

and maybe enter:

jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension

in the command window (running in the Anaconda directory)


(i think, "pip" instead of "conda" may also be used)


i get:
[IPKernelApp] ERREOR | No such comm target registered: jupyter.widget.version


...maybe i should try to do a fresh install of Anaconda? my installation is
quite old already....
