    "## Definition of Derivatives\n",
    "Imagine, we evaluate a given function $f(x)$ at a given input $x_0$. This gives an output $f(x_0)$ which is the $y$-coordinate of the point on the function graph whose $x$-coordinate is $x_0$, so let's call it $y_0$. Now, we also evaluate our function at a second input $x_1 = x_0+h$ which gives a second output $y_1 = f(x_0+h)$. We can compute the ratio of the two differences $\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$ where $\\Delta y = (y_1-y_0)$ and $\\Delta x = (x_1-x_0) = h$ which gives us the slope of the secant that goes through the two points $(x_0,y_0)$ and $(x_1,y_1)$. When the distance $h$ between our inputs becomes smaller and smaller, the slope of the secant approaches the slope of the tangent to the graph at the point $x_0$. So, we consider the limit of this ratio as $h$ approaches zero:\n",
    "$$f'(x_0) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0)}{h}$$\n",
    "and call that value the derivative of the function $f$ at the value $x_0$, provided that this limit exists and is finite - otherwise, the derivative is undefined at $x_0$. Note that the point, at which we evaluate this derivative, can be chosen arbitrarily - so we have in fact defined a new function (of $x_0$) which we may just call the derivative of $f$ (without the qualification \"at $x_0$\"). We may also replace the $x_0$ with $x$ itself as these letters are just exchangable dummy variables - and how we choose to name them has nothing to do with the nature of the function $f$. It is customary to denote that new function with a prime as has been done above. As an example, consider the example function $f(x) = (1+x^3) / (1+x^6)$."

    "So how would we go about finding a formula for the derivative $f'(x)$ of a given function $f(x)$? As a matter of fact, the process of taking the derivative of any elementary function (however complex it may be - \"elementary function\" does not mean simple in this context: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_function) has been fully figured out and can be and has been mechanized - so in practice, we may just use the sage command \"derivative\" or its shortcut \"diff\". However, it is instructive to compute a very simple example by hand to see how the process works. We'll choose $f(x) = x^2$ as our simple example function. Putting this concrete $f(x)$ into the general definition above, we obtain:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f'(x_0) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{(x_0+h)^2 - x_0^2}{h}\n",
    "        = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{x_0^2 + 2 x_0 h + h^2 - x_0^2}{h}\n",

    "        = 2 x_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "we note that $x_0$ is actually just the name of the input variable - it has nothing to do with the nature of the functions $f$ or $f'$ for that matter - so we may feel free to rename $x_0$ to $x$ and may say that $(x^2)' = 2x$. In general, we will find that $(x^n)'=nx^{n-1}$. You should also know that $(e^x)' = e^x$, $(\\sin x)' = \\cos(x)$, $(\\cos x)' = -\\sin(x)$, $(\\ln x)' = 1/x$ and if you like, you may look up a few more derivatives of basic functions here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative#Rules_for_basic_functions but nowadays, i wouldn't worry very much about memorizing too many of them.\n",

    "### Derivatives of Combined Functions\n",
    "OK, so we now have a little catalog with derivatives of a couple of basic functions. How would we compute the derivative, if the function is more complicated, say, like $f(x) = x^2 + e^x \\sin(x^2) / (1 + x^2)$? Well, we have only a handful of operations by which we can (recursively) build more complicated functions from simpler ones: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and composition (which means nesting or chaining - for example $\\sin(x^2)$ is a composition of $x^2$ with the sine function). For each of these operations, we have a rule for how the derivative for the combined function can be built from the derivatives of the component functions. These rules go by the names sum/difference rule, product rule, quotient rule and chain rule and read: $(f \\pm g)' = f' \\pm g'$, $(f g)' = f' g + g' f$, $(f/g)' = (f'g - g'f)/g^2$, $(f(g))' = g' f'(g)$ respectively. That's all that is needed to automate the process of taking derivatives, which can become tedious and error prone indeed if done by hand - so let's have a look at how we would do that in sage:"

The result of that is called a second derivative of $f$ and often denoted by $f''$. And similarly, $f'''$ - the third derivative - is the derivative of the second derivative, and so on. For derivatives of order $n$ higher than 3, one usually writes $f^{(n)}$. You will also notice that when iterating derivatives, the resulting expressions tend to become rather unwieldy really quick - that's what i meant by \"tedious and error prone\" above.
