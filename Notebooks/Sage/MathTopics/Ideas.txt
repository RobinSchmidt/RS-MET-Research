Taylor series
1 / (x^2 - 1) = sum_n -x^(2*n) - converges in x = -1..+1
1 / (x^2 + 1) = sum_n (-x^2)^n
or:
1 / (1 - x^2)
1 / (1 + x^2)
...maybe sage can be made to spit out a formula for the series 
coeffs?

"reductor" for fractions whose elements are also fractions. 
example: (1/2)/(1/3) = 3/2, obtained by dividing both by 1/6
i think the reductor of (a/b)/(c/d) can be computed as gcd(a,b)/lcm(b,d)
the idea is to obtain a fraction of integers with the smallest
possible denominator

complex rationals - numbers of the form (a + b*i)/(c + d*i) where
a,b,c,d a rational numbers
-the canonical representant of an equivalence class of such fractions
is the one that has the smallest possible integers for a,b,c,d and
whose numerator is in the 1st quadrant
