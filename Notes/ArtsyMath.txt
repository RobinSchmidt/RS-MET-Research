Collection of intersting formulas and algorithms to create art with math. The following curves are 
given either in paramteric form (x(t), y(t)) where t can be thought of as time or r(t) where t is 
an angle "theta" or implicitly as f(x,y) = 0 perhaps written as f(x,y) = g(x,y).

...there are more...


From the comments:
(sin(x)+(sin(x*2)+sin(x/2))/2)/2 > cos(y)  ..this is an inequality
sin(x^y)=0

..the stuff with the gcd looks cool. i wonder how that is implemented. maybe by just rounding?

Ideas and Questions:
-For the implictly given curves, we could also do (filled) contour plots like f(x,y) = c for some 
 set of selected levels c. We could either use a colormap or use 3 different variants of f(x,y) and 
 use them for R,G,B. It may also make sense to pass the final height function z = f(x,y) through 
 some sort of waveshaper to tame infinities at poles (if any) and/or to change the distribution
 of the contour lines.
 Use rsImageContourPlotter for that
-Maybe we can also do some (loopable) animations by introducing a parameter into the formulas that 
 varies over time. We could either vary the paremeter sinusoidally or use a formula that is itself
 periodic in the time parameter. Maybe for the implicit formulas converted to f(x,y) = c, the 
 parameter could be the contour level.
-How an we create arbitrary shapes (maybe given implicitly) as envelopes from straight (or maybe 
 slightly curved) lines?
-How can we generalize this to 3D? We can draw curves in 3 space as well and then do a perspective
 projection which we could animate by letting the camera rotate around the object. We could also 
 create surfaces. Maybe that could be done best in Blender.
-Maybe make some sort of Fibonacci spirals, i.e. draw points (circles) in positions determined by 
 the golden angle as seen in sunflowers. Maybe these points could be more complicated objects like
 (Gaussian) blobs of varying size. Maybe we could also use a 2D Gaussian with elliptic contours and
 give each ellipse its own rotation angle
-Use fractals - Lindenmayer based and iteration based. ...somehow, not yet sure how
