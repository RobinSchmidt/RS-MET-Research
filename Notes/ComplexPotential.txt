We try to find a potential function for the complex function:
 
   w(z) = z^2
   
seen as 2D Polya vector field:
 
   w(x,y) = (x^2-y^2, -2*x*y) = (w1(x,y), w2(x,y))
   
We integrate w1 with respect to x:

  P(x,y) = x^3/3 - x*y^2 + g(y)
  
To find g(y), we take the partial derivative of P with respect to y and compare
the result to our desired -2*x*y:

  dP/dy = -2*x*y + g'(y)
  
which turns out to be exactly equal to what we want if we set g'(y) = 0, so we 
may also use g(y) = 0. This is not always the case - we may have to find a 
function of y alone that we can add, to make the partial derivative equal to 
what we want. So, setting g(y) = 0, our potential becomes: 

  P(x,y) = x^3/3 - x*y^2

To verify it, we compute the partial derivatives of P with respect to x,y:

  dP/dx = x^2 - y^2
  dP/dy = -2*x*y

so our P(x,y) does indeed work as potential for our Polya vector field. How 
about integrating w2 with respect to y:

  Q(x,y) = -2*x*y^2 / 2 = -x*y^2 + g(x)

find the partial derivative of Q with respect to x:

  dQ/dx = -y^2 + g'(x)

which should be equal to x^2 - y^2, so we need g'(x) = x^2. Integrating with 
respect to x gives: g(x) = x^3/3 + C. Setting C to zero, we get:

  Q(x,y) = -x*y^2 + x^3/3

which equals P(x,y) that we computed before.


Notes:

Generalizing this to w(z) = z^n requires use of the binomial theorem.

By looking at the plot of the potential of the Polya vector field, we can 
identify the zeros of the original functions as the extrema and saddles of 
the potential, and the extrema of the original function are points of 
steepest slope. I think, we can also identify fixed points by looking at the
potential of f(z) - z instead of f(z) itself. The zeros of f(z) - z should be
the fixed points of f(z).

ToDo:
-work out the potential for some other important functions such as 1/z, exp(z),
 sin(z), cos(z), log(z), etc.



Questions:
-when we don't take the Polya vector field, i.e. the vector field obtained by
 taking the complex conjugate, we don't get a potential field - the sign of the
 imaginary part is wrong. However - does it make sense to consider that field, 
 too?
-Has this use of -1 something to do with "integrating factors", i.e. the -1 is 
 such an integrating factor?
-Does the potential help to evaluate and/or make sense of complex path 
 integrals?
