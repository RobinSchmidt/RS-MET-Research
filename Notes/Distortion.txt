The goal is to devise a flexible distortion algorithm that is able to capture dynamic behavior and
be musically tweakable, i.e. should offer parameters that correlate well with perceptual features
of the distortion. It should be flexible enough to recreate behaviors of guitar pedals and 
amplifiers

-Analyze a distortion device in terms of harmonic amplitudes and phases for input sinusoids of given
 frequencies and amplitudes. Maybe visualize the result for each harmonic as a heat-map, i.e. in a 
 spectrogram like fashion just that what normally is time now becomes input amplitude. Maybe 
 restrict the attention to only the first few harmonics like 1...5. For each harmonic we'll get a
 "sprectrogram"...maybe we could call it "distortogram" or "harmonigram1,2,3 etc."
 
-Create different parametrized models and use them to try to recreate the so analyzed behavior. 
 Maybe a sort of learning algorithm can be devised to learn the parameters. Models could include 
 things like a simple waveshaper, waveshaper with pre/post filters (maybe biquad), 
 multiband-waveshaper, networks of units of those types.
