Given a matrix A, we want to compile a list of operations that we can perfrom
with it in order to manipulate the eigenvalues in a controlled way while 
leaving the eigenvectors as is.

-Scaling the matrix by a scalar s: B = s*A scales all eigenvalues by the same 
 scalar.
-Adding a scaled identity matrix: B = A + s*I shifts all eigenvalues by s.
-A^-1 has reciprocal eigenvalues of A.
-A^n has eigenvalues of A raised to the power of n.
-A^T has the same eigenvalues as A.
-A^T * A has eigenvalues of A squared?
-If A is diagonalizable we can express it as A = V * D * V^-1 where the columns 
 of V are the eigenvectors and D is the diagonal matrix containing the 
 eigenvalues. In this representation, we can set them to anything we want and 
 then multiply out the product to obtain our final matrix with desired 
 eigenvalues and same eigenvectors as A.

Questions:
-What about A^H?
-What about exp(A) or more generally f(A) where f is expressed as power series?
-What about A+B and A*B for general A, B?
-What about the singular value decomposition? Could that be helpful? Maybe it 
 could do something similar like the diagonalization approach but also with 
 matrices that are not diagonalizable?
-Can we rotate the eigenvectors while leaving the eigenvalues as is? Maybe by 
 using something like: A = V * D * V^-1, B = R^-1 * A * R for some rotation 
 matrix R?
-Can we rotate a specific eigenvector?
