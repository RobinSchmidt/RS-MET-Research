Features:

- Implementation goals and considerations:
  - Should be templatized and at least support float, double, SIMD-vectors, multiprecision-float.
    That rules out usage of std::complex. We need a more flexible complex datatype that can work 
	with SIMD and multiprecision.
  - Should be realtime capable: sample and buffer based processing functions shall never allocate 
    memory. Filter parameter updates (e.g. change of cutoff freq) should also work without 
	allocations. They also shall not acquire locks. Any thread-sync should be done on a higher level
	and is not within the responsibility of this library.
  - Should be implemented as C++20 module.
  - Should define two C++20 concepts: Signal and Parameter
  - Maybe a library for dealing with polynomials and rational functions should be factored out. Such
    a library may be useful in its own right.

- Prototype Designs:
  - Butterworth, Chebychev 1/2, Elliptic lowpass and low-shelving filters via closed form formulas
    for the s-plane poles and zeros
  - Bessel, Papoulis, Halpern and Gaussian via formulas for polynomial coeffs and root-finder

- Frequency transformations:
  - s-plane LP/LP, LP/HP, LP/BP, LP/BR, LP/LS (LS = low-shelv)
  - z-plane LP/LP, ... (Constantinides formulas)
  - bilinear s-to-z and z-to-s transform
  - s-to-z via MZTi, Nyquist frequency match

- Different implementation structures and conversion routines for the coeffs of the different 
  structures:
  - ZPK-form (zeros, poles, gain) - that's the form in which prototypes are designed.
  - Biquad cascade (called second order sections (SOS) in Matlab)
  - Lattice form 
  - Parallel biquads (good for parallelization and bidirectional application)
  - Direct form (not recommened to use but for the sake of completeness)
  - Biquads can be implemented in SVF (state variable) form and state-vector form and in all 4 
    direct forms.
  
- Implementations should be applicable to:
  - Realtime processing as in audio plugin, i.e. sample-by-sample processing should be possible.
  - Batch-processing on multi-dimensional arrays by using strides, i.e. we filter along a particular 
    dimension. Should ideally be compatible with std::mdspan - at least for strided layouts. 
  - We should be able to apply them bidirectionally using the exact formulas for the states after
    (ringout/warm-up)
  - Should be applicable to non-uniformly sampled data.
 
- More feature ideas: 
  - Maybe compensation allpass designs
  - Maybe transitional filters can be provided, too
  - Maybe iterative design of arbitrary filters based on iterative optimization - but: maybe that 
    should be based on some library dedicated to iterative optimization. Maybe it should be and
	optional feature and if that feature is not needed, the rest of the library will work without
	having the optimization library installed.  
  - Maybe biquad designs based on magnitude samples 
  - Crossover designs with perfect reconstruction

  - mdarray is the owning version (like vector is to span)
  - rank (= number of dimensions) must be known at compile time

-The length can be a runtime or compile-time variable. I guess that implies that for a typical
 convolution routine, the compiler could generate *many* versions for all sorts of different 
 compile-time constants for the length of the span? That might be bad. Although, it may inline such
 a small routine anyway.
