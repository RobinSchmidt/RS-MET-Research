% It's important to use compat=1.12 ...or maybe higher. With 1.9, it didn't work. I think, with 
% compatibility to earlier versions, the coordinates are interpreted differently, i.e. as 
% "screen-coodinates" rather than "world-coordinates" or something like that. I think, it can be 
% fixed with older versions by using "(axis cs: 0,0,0)" instead of "(0,0,0)". The fancy torus 
% example uses this method. But it's inconvenient.

%
% ToDo:
% -Figure out how we can a different number of samples for the 2nd parameter. Using "y samples = 21" 
%  didn't work. samples={11}{21} also didn't. Aha! It's "samples y = 21"
