% This file is for creating and tweaking one plot at a time. When working on one plot, we don't want
% to do that in the context of a document that contains a lot of other stuff because that makes the
% edit -> compile -> inspect cycle very long. We create and tweak the plot here and once it's
% finished, we move the code over into another place like DemoPlots.tex.

\include{Setup}

% These two lines will show the preview picture on a page that is adapted to the size of the pic:
%\usepackage[active,tightpage]{preview}
%\PreviewEnvironment{tikzpicture}


\begin{document}


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering

% The numbers in the comment behind the plot give a good setting for width, height, i.e. 18,15 means
% that the plot looks good when using "\pgfplotsset{width=18cm,height=15cm}", for example. 18,12..15
% gives a range of 12 to 15 for the height

\pgfplotsset{width=18cm,height=12cm}

% Finished plots:
%\include{Plots/TikZ_SaddleWithAxes}                  % 18,12..15
%\include{Plots/TikZ_GaussTimesX_Heat}                 % 18,12
%\include{Plots/TikZ_Torus}                           % 18,12

% Drafts:
%\include{Draft/TikZ_ParabolicPavillon}          % 18,12

% 3rd Party examples:
%\pgfplotsset{width=18cm,height=15cm} 
%\include{3rdParty/TikZ_Helicoid}                 % 18,15
%\include{3rdParty/TikZ_ParabolicDome}             % the width,height call seems to make no difference
%\include{3rdParty/TikZ_FancyTorus}
\include{3rdParty/TikZ_MoebiusStrip}              % 18,12
