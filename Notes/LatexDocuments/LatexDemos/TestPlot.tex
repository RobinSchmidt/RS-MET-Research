% This file is for creating and tweaking one plot at a time. When working on one plot, we don't want
% to do that in the context of a document that contains a lot of other stuff because that makes the
% edit -> compile -> inspect cycle very long. We create and tweak the plot here and once it's
% finished, we move the code over into another place like DemoPlots.tex.

\include{Setup}

% These two lines will show the preview picture on a page that is adapted to the size of the pic:
