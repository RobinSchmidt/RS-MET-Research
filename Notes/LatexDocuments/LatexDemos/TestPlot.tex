% This file is for creating and tweaking one plot at a time. When working on one plot, we don't want
% to do that in the context of a document that contains a lot of other stuff because that makes the
% edit -> compile -> inspect cycle very long. We create and tweak the plot here and once it's
% finished, we move the code over into another place like DemoPlots.tex.
