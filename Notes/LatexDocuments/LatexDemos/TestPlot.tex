% This file is for creating and tweaking one plot at a time. When working on one plot, we don't want
% to do that in the context of a document that contains a lot of other stuff because that makes the
% edit -> compile -> inspect cycle very long. We create and tweak the plot here and once it's
% finished, we move the code over into another place like DemoPlots.tex.

% For the 1/x, -1/x, it would be nice to get rid of the vertical line at x=0. Maybe we can to the 
% plot in two parts? from -1...-0.01 and the from 0.01..1
