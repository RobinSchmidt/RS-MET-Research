% Notes:
%
% When using "fill=white" instead of "colormap/viridis", all the factes are painted white such that 
% it looks like a cheaper variant of a surface plot. Using less than 40 samples makes it look rather
% rough. Uisng the "smooth" option doesn't work for this - apparently, this is only for curves and 
% not for surfaces. To control the colors of the lines, one has to use e.g. "faceted color=black". 
% Without that option, it seems to use some light shade of gray and the lines look thinner - but that 
% may be an optical illusion because of the lighter color.
%
% ToDo: 
% 
% Maybe instead of specifying the color as rsGray20, use some name like meshGray. Rationale: We may
% want to change the color for all plots at once. The Setup.tex file then acts like a style sheet. 
% Maybe we can do something similar for the color-map, i.e, define a name like colorMapUnipolar, 
% colorMapBipolar, etc.
