% Notes:
% When using "fill=white" instead of "colormap/viridis", all the factes are painted white such that 
% it looks like a cheaper variant of a surface plot. Using less than 40 samples makes it look rather
% rough. Uisng the "smooth" option doesn't work for this - apparently, this is only for curves and 
% not for surfaces. To control the colors of the lines, one has to use e.g. "faceted color=black". 
% Without that option, it seems to use some light shade of gray and the lines look thinner - but that 
% may be an optical illusion because of the lighter color.
