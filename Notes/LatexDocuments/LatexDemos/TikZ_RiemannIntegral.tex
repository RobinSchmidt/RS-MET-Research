$\begin{aligned}
&\int_{a}^{b} \sin(x) \; dx \approx \sum_{n=1}^{N} \Delta x \cdot \sin(x_n) \quad \text{where} \\

% I don't know why the normal equation or equation* doesn't work. It's weird to use the $ with the
% aligned environment. But this is the only way, I could make it work and compile without error.
% Using just inline math via $...$ without aligned will give the small inlnie math font with tiny
% integral and sum sign which looks ugly here. It took some trial and error to figure this out.

% Maybe the rectangles below the x-axis should use another color like red
