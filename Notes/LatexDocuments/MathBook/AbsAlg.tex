\chapter{Abstract Algebra}
In the course of this book, we have encountered a great number of so called algebraic structures such as different number systems, vector spaces, etc.. So far, each of these structures more or less stood by itself. It's time to take a step back and recognize commonalities and differences among them and bring some order into this disorganized chaos. Doing so is the realm of abstract algebra. It abstracts out the commonalities between these disparate algebraic structures and establishes a common terminology and notation to talk about such things. Furthermore, it establishes some theorems that will hold for all structures that sastisfy a certain set of axioms. This may potentially economize a lot of math: if you come up with a new algebraic structure by yourself and are able to verify the axioms of a given known structure, you will immediately have a whole bunch of proven theorems in your hand without having to wade through all the tedious proofs for your concrete case again. Checking, if a smallish set of axioms holds true for your new structure will typically be much easier than trying to re-prove each and every theorem from some other known structure for the new structure. It also proves that certain structures that you may hope to discover (like, say, a 3D division algebra) cannot possibly exist, potentially saving you from some headaches in a futile search ...tbc...

sections:
-Groups
 -Consists of a set and an operation that maps two members from the set to another member of the set.
 -If the operation is commutative, the group is called Abelian.
-Rings
 -Is a group in which each element has an inverse with respect to the group operation (verify!).
 -Defines a second operation that in itself follows similar rules as the first (associativity, maybe commutativity) and satisfies the distributive law when combined with the group operation.
-Fields
 -Is a ring in which each element except 0 has a multiplicative inverse.
-Vector Spaces
 -Consists of 2 sets, scalars and vectors, with operations between them ...tbc...
-Algebras
 -Consists of a vector space and another operation (a "product") between vectors that yields another vector
-Representations
 -Each abstract group can be represented by an appropriately chosen set of matrices. The elements map to the matrices, the group operation maps to matrix multiplication.
 -The choice of the set of matrices need not be unique.
 -In certain cases, the structure may be upped to an algebra where a Lie bracket serves as the "product". A Lie bracket can be the commutator, the anticommutator, etc.
-Division algebra


This chapter should perhaps go neither into the continuous math nor in the discrete math part but rather in some subsequent "overarching" part
