\section{Fields}
In the realm of abstract algebra, a \emph{field} is a ring with some additional requirements. It must be a unital ring, which means that a multiplicative identity (i.e. neutral element) must exist. We will also require that all elements except the additive identity must have multiplicative inverses. The exception is motivated by the idea that division by zero is impossible. It turns out that this will case for any field if we want $a \cdot 0 = a \cdot (0 + 0) = a \cdot 0 + a \cdot 0$ to be true for any $a$ that is an element of our field. Furthermore, we require that the multiplication is also commutative. The prototypical examples of fields are the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ and the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. Whenever we have a field, we can do computations with the elements of the field in the same way that we are used to from elementary school. That means, we can add, subtract, multiply and divide to our hearts content with the sole exception of division by zero. As with rings, we denote a field as a triple $(\mathbb{F}, +, \cdot)$ made from an underlying set $\mathbb{F}$ and two operations which we call addition and multiplication. Formally, the requirements for a field are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $(\mathbb{F},+,\cdot)$ forms a unital ring, i.e. a ring with a multiplicative neutral element.
\item Every element except the additive neutral element has a multiplicative inverse element.
\item Multiplication is commutative.
\end{itemize}
Because these properties are stated at a pretty high level, let's state them boiled down to a lower level:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{l l}
Additive closure: 
& $\forall a,b \in \mathbb{F}: \; a + b \in \mathbb{F}$  \\	
Multiplicative closure: 
& $\forall a,b \in \mathbb{F}: \; a \cdot b \in \mathbb{F}$  \\	
Associativity of addition: 
& $\forall a,b,c \in \mathbb{F}: \;  (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$   \\
Associativity of multiplication: 
& $\forall a,b,c \in \mathbb{F}: \;  (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$   \\
Commutativity of addition: 
& $\forall a,b \in \mathbb{F}: \;  a + b = b + a$   \\
Commutativity of multiplication: 
& $\forall a,b \in \mathbb{F}: \;  a \cdot b = b \cdot a$   \\
Existence of additive identity: 
& $\exists 0 \in \mathbb{F}: \; (\forall a \in \mathbb{F}: 0 + a = a)$ \\
Existence of multiplicative identity: 
& $\exists 1 \in \mathbb{F}: \; (\forall a \in \mathbb{F}: 1 \cdot a = a)$ \\
Existence of additive inverses: 
& $\forall a \in \mathbb{F}: \; (\exists (-a) \in \mathbb{F}: (-a) + a = 0 )$ \\
Existence of multiplicative inverses: 
& $\forall a \in \mathbb{F} \setminus \{0\}: \; (\exists a^{-1} \in \mathbb{F}: a^{-1} \cdot a = 1 )$ \\
Multiplication distributes over addition: 
& $\forall a,b,c \in R: \;  
a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c, \; 
(b + c) \cdot a = b \cdot a + c \cdot a$
\end{tabular}
\medskip
[...todo: verify that the list is complete]

Any mathematical structure that satisfies these requirements is a structure in which can do calculations and solve equations in the same way as we are used to from the rational or real numbers. The rational numbers can be seen as the prototypical example of a field after which the abstraction was modeled.

% The right-distributive law is actually redundant bcs we have commutative multiplication
 
%As usual, $\mathbb{F}^*$ is a shorthand for $\mathbb{F} \setminus \{0\}$.


\subsection{Subfields and Extension Fields}
By now, you know the drill already: if a subset of the underlying set of a given field forms itself a field (under the same operations), then we say that this subset forms a subfield of our given field (under these operations). We already know examples of such subfield relations. $\mathbb{R}$ is a subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ is a subfield of $\mathbb{R}$ and therefore also of $\mathbb{C}$ (the relation is transitive). From the perspective of $\mathbb{Q}$, the bigger fields $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ are called extension fields [VERIFY]. 

% R is transcendental extension of Q and C is algebraic extension of R?

% R is subfield of C,  Q is subfield of R (and therefore also of C)

% Notation is similar to adjoining elements to a ring - just using () instead of []

\subsubsection{Algebraic Extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$}
It is well known that the square root of two is not a rational number. If we just adjoin $\sqrt{2}$ to the field of rational numbers and then make sure to also add everything else that is needed to continue to satisfy the field axioms, we obtain an extended field which we denote by $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. This is totally analogous to what we did with rings when adjoining a new element, just that for fields we use parentheses like $(\ldots)$ instead of brackets like $[\ldots]$ It turns out that the elements of our extended field can always be written in the form $a + b \sqrt{2}$ where $a,b, \in \mathbb{Q}$.

% What about Q(x) ...I think, this is the field of rational functions over Q?

\begin{comment}

Explain the edge case where additive neutral elements have a multiplicative inverse. I think Michael Penn has a video about that called somethign like "when division by zero isn't ..." IIRC	

 We have used the symbol $1$ to denote the multiplicative neutral element. 

The notation $a^{-1}$ is now used for the multiplicative inverse of $a$, so we need a new notation for the additive inverse. We will use $-a$ to denote the additive inverse of $a$. In the axiom about multiplicative inverses, we have excluded the $0$ element. The additive neutral element (i.e. zero) is the only element for which we do not require to have a multiplicative inverse. It can in fact be shown that - some uninteresting trivial edge cases aside - the additive neutral element cannot possibly have a multiplicative inverse in any ring.

-In groups, we can always solve equations like a*x = b
-In fields, we can always solve equations like a*x + b = c (in rings only sometimes)
-In algebraically closed fields, we can always solve polynomial equations - but only in principle, 
 i.e. in the sense that solutions exist and we may find them numerically. Up to degree 4, there are
 formulas in terms of the coeffs. ...do these formulas also apply to finite fields?
-Field extensions can be writte like R/Q or just with the subset symbol
-Degree of field extension: if L is a field extesnion over K. We may interpret L as a vector space 
 over K. For example. C is a field extension over R has degree 2. We write this as 
 [C:R] = dim_R(C) = 2, dim_F(F) = 1 always, [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] dim_Q(Q(sqrt(2))) = 2,
 [Q(cbrt(2)) : Q] = 3  bcs  Q(cbrt(2))  = { a + b sqrt(2) + c cbrt(2^2) :  a,b,c in Q }
 [R : Q] = inf, R = { a + b r_1 + c * r_2 + d * r_3 + ...   where r_in in R }
 [F(a) : F] = deg(m_a(x)) where m_a(x) is the minimal polynomial for a (a is an algebraic number)
 For a chain of field extensions F \subset G \subset H we have:
 [H :  F] = [H : G] * [G : F]
