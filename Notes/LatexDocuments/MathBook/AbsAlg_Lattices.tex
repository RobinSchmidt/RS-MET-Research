\section{Lattices}
A lattice is a tuple $(L, \vee, \wedge)$ representing an algebraic structure consisting of a partially ordered set ("poset") $L$ and two binary operations $\vee$, which is called "join" and $\wedge$, which is called "meet".  ...TBC... Examples: $(\mathbb{Z}, \max, \min)$, $(\{ \bot, \top \}, \vee, \wedge)$, $(\mathsf{SET}, \cup, \cap)$ ..verify!

See: A Book of Set theory (ABoST)

Examples:
-Integers with min/max for meet/join respectively
-{true, false} with logical and/or for meet/join
-The class of all sets with intersection/union for meet/join
 We could also use the power set P(S) of a given set S instead of the class of all sets

Specific Lattices:
-L-groups: combine a group and a lattice, where the group operations are compatible with the 
 lattice operations (examples: integers?)
-Boolean Algebra: see ABoST
