\subsection{Classical Mechanics}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Newtonian Mechanics}
Newtonian mechanics is the classical approach to classical mechanics discovered by the famous British physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton himself. Newtonian mechanics predicts, how a particle with mass $m$ will respond to the force $F$ exerted on it. It will respond by changing its state of motion. The response will be a \emph{change} of its \emph{velocity} $v$ according to the applied force. This is encapsulated in the fundamental law $F = m a$ where $a$ is the acceleration. Acceleration is literally defined as a change of velocity $v$: $a = \frac{dv}{dt}$. These scalar equations apply to motion in a single dimension. This may be good enough in some simple cases but in general, force, velocity and acceleration are generally treated as vector valued quantities (mass remains scalar, though). The appropriate mathematical framework that is used nowadays is that of \emph{vector calculus} although that field was not yet developed at Newton's time. He had to use different, more elementary formulations, i.e. he had to write out all the sums of partial derivatives explicitly where we today use more convenient differential operators which encapsulate such commonly occurring sums like in div, curl, etc. [VERIFY]. In the modern formulation of Newtonian physics, you will see a lot of such \emph{differential operators} to compute one vector valued quantity from another at a point. You will also see a lot of \emph{line integrals}, for example to compute the energy that a particle gains or loses when it moves through a force field. You will use the theorem for \emph{potential fields} when the force field happens to be conservative, which it often is. You will see \emph{volume integrals}, for example to compute a total mass and center of mass of an object given its density as function of $x,y,z$. You will also see a lot of systems of \emph{ordinary differential equations}. That's the sort of math that is used in Newtonian mechanics. Mostly calculus.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Lagrangian Mechanics}
Newtonian mechanics revolves around the equation $F = m a$ or $\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}$ in multiple dimensions. In order to be applicable to predict the evolution of a given system, we typically need to be able to calculate what the the total force vector $\mathbf{F}$ is. In some problem settings, it is hard to come by with an explicit expression for the force $\mathbf{F}$. [VERIFY] In such cases, it might be easier to choose an approach that involves the kinetic and potential energies rather than the forces. Kinetic energy is the energy stored in the motion of an object whereas potential energy is energy that is stored in the position of an object. ...TBC...

% a higher level approach from which the Newtonian equations emerge. is it really a "higher level" or just a different approach?
% especially applicable to probelms with constraint forces?

% math: calculus of variations ...was that already developed at Lagrange's time?

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Hamiltonian Mechanics} [VERIFY ALL]
In Lagrangian mechanics, the central quantity of interest was the so called Lagrangian of a system which is the kinetic energy \emph{minus} the potential energy. In Hamiltonian mechanics, the quantity of interest is the kinetic energy \emph{plus} the potential energy, i.e. the total energy. This total energy is also called the Hamiltonian in this context. ...TBC...

\paragraph{The Legendre Transformation}
The recipe to convert back and forth between the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formulation of a given problem is called the Legendre transformation (which should not be confused with the Legendre transform - a certain type of integral transform). ...TBC...

\subsection{Quantum Mechanics}
Quantum mechanics deals with the world of atomic and subatomic particles. It turns out that their behavior is not adequately described by classical mechanics. Classical mechanics describes the behavior of point like particles in a deterministic way. This is not how such small particles behave. Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of spatially smeared out particles in a probabilistic way. The main tool is the so called \emph{quantum wavefunction}. This is a complex valued (!) function of space and time and typically denoted by the greek letter psi as $\Psi = \Psi(t,x,y,z)$. There is a law called the \emph{Born rule} that allows us to convert the complex values of the wavefunction into probabilities of observing the particle in a particular \emph{state}, e.g. at a particular position.


%The do not behave in a deterministic way like classical particles do but rather in a probabilistic way. This behavior is captured in a mathematical object called the quantum wavefunction which is the primary tool to describe the particle

% they are also not point-like but rather spread out in space

\subsection{Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics}
This subfield of physics deals with the application of Newtonian (and sometimes quantum) mechanics to particle systems with a number of particles that is so huge, that it's impossible and also not meaningful to try to describe what individual particles do. Instead, one considers the properties of the whole ensemble of particles as a whole. Notions like density, pressure and temperature are developed as \emph{emergent} properties of the whole ensemble. The mathematical tools that are required for this are the ideas from probability theory and statistics. ...TBC...

General Relativity:

Famous quote by physicist John Archibald Wheeler about the essence of general relativity:

"Spacetime tells matter how to move, matter tells spacetime how to curve."

Analogy in Newton's world:
Forces tell masses how to move (accelerate): F = m a, a = F/m. Masses tell (gravitational) forces how to pull: F_g = G m_1 m_2 r / |r|^3. Maybe Newton's law should be rephrased in terms of momentum to make the analogy even closer: d p / d t = F

In relativity: The change of the energy-mmomentum tensor is some function of the metric tensor - in a sloppy symbolic way: T_{\mu \nu} = f( g_{\mu \nu} ) and likewise g_{\mu \nu} = f^{-1} (T_{\mu \nu}). But actually the function $f$ also depend on spatial and temporal derivatives of the (tensor valued) quantity $g$, not just on $g$ itself - although, if we assume $g = g(t,x,y,z)$ then that function actually contains all the info abouts its (partial) derivatives anyway. But usually, when we write down a differential equation, we make such dependencies on derivatives epxlicit by writing things like: $f(g, g_t, g_x, g_y, g_z, g_{tt}, g_{tx}, g_{ty}, \ldots)$

at 7:50, she says, "they are differential equations for the metric tensor". So, the focus seems to be on the time evolution of g, not T. The equations by themselves describe both on equal footing (I think)
