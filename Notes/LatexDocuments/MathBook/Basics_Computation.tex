\section{Computation}
No that we have numbers, we want to do something with them. That something is computation ...tbc...

\subsection{Arithmetic}
Arithmetic is about performing the elementary operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and on a higher level also exponentiation and extraction of roots. I would argue that when taking roots is included, taking logarithms should be included as well for consistency (both operations are ways of inverting the exponentiation), but that's usually not listed among the arithmetic operations. Be that as it may, we will look at logarithms in this section, too. We will also learn sum and product notation, the factorial and binomial coefficients...tbc...

ToDo:

-introduce positional number systems, in particular decimal and maybe binary as alternative
-give algorithms for long addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
-maybe also for numbers in scientific notation, i.e. floating point numbers
-introduce sum and product notation
 -maybe with a spoiler to infinite sums, use $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (1/10)^k = 0.1111... = 1/9$ as example
-introduce sums, products, factorials and binomial coefficients
-but maybe that stuff should go into the "Elementary Algebra" section because it involves 
 variables

%\subsection{Elementary Algebra}
%Elementary algebra is about solving an equation for an unknown variable, typically denoted as $x$. This is done by isolating $x$ on one side of the equation and moving all known quantities to the other side. On this other side, no unknown quantity should occur anymore such that it can be directly evaluated. ...tbc...
% example 2 x + 3 = 9 -> 2 x = 6 -> x = 3
% Really ...is it? Or is elementary algebra more generally "computation with letters"?
% ...yep...wikipedia says so

ToDo:
-make a (sub)section "Algebraic Reasoning" analogous to the "Geometric Reasoning" section in the Geometry chapter, so we can refer from there to here for analogies

Factoring a sum of two cubic terms into a linear and quadratic factor: 
  a^3 + b^3 = (a + b) (a^2 - a b + b^2)
Can be put near the binomial formulas

Maybe this whole section should be called Elementary Algebra.
This video says (at 5:25):

(elementary) algebra is the study of abstraction applied to numbers. One could perhaps also
say: computing with letters ("Rechnen mit Buchstaben")

What other types of "Computation" could we have? Maybe I should explain the basic algorithms 
for hand-calculations with pen and paper?
