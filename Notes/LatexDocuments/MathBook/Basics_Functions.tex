-polynomials, rational functions, power series, trig-functions, exp/log, floor/ceil/round, atan2
-symmetry, periodicity, boundedness, maybe continuity (but maybe defer to calculus, we'll see where it fits best)
-maybe explain functions also as unary operators? abs, negation

Features:
-monotonicity, boundedness, symmetry (-> decomposition int symmetric and antisysmmetric part), domain, range, injective/surjective/bijective

How to define functions:
-explicitly, e.g. y = x^2
-piecewise (may also be explicit but that's actually an independent question)
-by an algorithm (see fractal functions (Bolzano function) Weitz video "Monster der Analysis")
-by data (togther with an interpolation rule)
-power series, integral, differential equation
-as the solution of a given problem (let f(x) be the solution of ..blabla)
-implicit functions ...maybe something like 
 y + exp(y) = x + sin(x), y - exp(y) = x + sin(x), y - exp(y) = x - sin(x), y + exp(y) = sqrt(x^x)
 is this an example?: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function
 if not, then maybe it should be considered as yet another way to define a function
