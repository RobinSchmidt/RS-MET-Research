\section{Differentiation}

%\subsubsection{Differentiation}
Consider an arbitrary function $f(x)$ and imagine that we want to compute the slope of the graph at a given $x_0$. We could approximate it by considering the point $(x_0, f(x_0))$ and another point on the graph a small distance $h$ further to the right $(x_0+h, f(x_0+h))$ and compute the "rise over run" quotient $(f(x_0+h) - f(x_0)) / h$ which would give us the slope of a secant. For smaller and smaller $h$, the approximation would get better and better because the secant would approach the tangent. Now we consider the limit as $h$ approaches zero. If that limit exists, it actually \emph{is} our desired slope of the tangent. We denote that tangent slope at $x_0$ as $f'(x_0)$. This leads us to the following definition:
\begin{equation}
  f'(x_0) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)}{h}
\end{equation}
We note that we could compute this limit at any value of $x_0$ where that limit exists, so if the limit exists everywhere, we can actually replace $x_0$ by $x$ because $x_0$ just an arbitrary variable name anyway which we may choose any way we want, as long as the name doesn't collide with any other names in the equation. Then, this definition actually defines a whole new function $f'(x)$. This new function $f'$ is called the derivative of $f$.

\paragraph{Example} Let $f(x) = x^2$. Plugging it into the definition above, using $x$ in place of $x_0$ as explained, we get:
\begin{equation}
  f'(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{(x + h)^2 - x^2}{h}
        = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{x^2 + 2 h x + h^2 - x^2}{h} 
        = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{2 h x + h^2}{h} 
        = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} 2 x + h
        = 2 x
\end{equation}
so the derivative of $f(x) = x^2$ is $f'(x) = 2 x$.

Fortunately, we don't have to go through this tedious procedure via the limit everytime we need to compute a derivative. Instead, we have a lookup list of derivatives of all important elementary functions that has been assembled once and for all by the technique above or otherwise and we have a couple of rules how to compute derivatives of more complicated functions that are created in various ways from the more basic functions (btw: Did I already say that a big theme in math is finding computational shortcuts? This is a nice example). These rules are:

%linearity, chain rule, product rule, quotient rule
