\section{Ordinary Differential Equations} 
Ordinary differential equations (abbreviated as ODEs) are equations in which the unknown quantity is not just a single variable like $x$, i.e. a number, but rather a full function $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The equation may contain the function itself as well as derivatives of it. The presence of derivatives is what makes it a "differential" equation. The goal is to find a function $f = f(x)$ that obeys a certain given relationship between itself and its own derivatives. For example, the function $f(x) = \e^x$ obeys the relation $f = f'$ and the function $f(x) = \sin (x)$ obeys the relation $f = -f''$. These two are perhaps the simplemost nontrivial examples of ODEs and are practically very relevant. In ODEs, what we are \emph{given} is the relation like $f = -f''$ and what is to be found, i.e. what is \emph{unknown}, is $f$ itself. Consider the slightly more complicated example $f + a_1 f' + a_2 f'' = 0$ for some given constant coefficients $a_1, a_2$. We see that for $a_1 = 0, a_2 = 1$, this ODE reduces to the ODE for the sine: $f = -f''$ and for $a_1 = -1, a_2 = 0$, we get the ODE for the exponential function $f = f'$. Solving the differential equation means to find a function $f = f(x)$, which, when it is being plugged into the ODE and all the derivatives are evaluated, yields a true statement. It can straightforwardly (albeit tediously) be verified by evaluating the derivatives that $f = c_1 \e^{-\sigma x} + c_2 \e^{\sigma x}$ is indeed a solution to $f + a_1 f' + a_2 f'' = 0$ when we choose $\sigma = (a_1 + \sqrt{a_1^2 - 4 a_2})/(2 a_2)$. We will actually go through this example in more detail later. For now, I'll just say that \emph{verifying} that some given function is a solution to an ODE is an easy task but \emph{finding} such a solution in the first place is hard. This is a bit like with finding vs verifying antiderivatives but even more so - meaning that finding the solution is even harder in general. Some people even refer to the process of finding a solution to a differential equation as "integrating the differential equation" and integration is indeed often needed as a subtask in the process of solving an ODE. I'm not so fond of that terminology (it sounds unnecessarily obtuse) and will just call it "solving the ODE" rather than "integrating the ODE".

\subsubsection{Oscillation}
Oscillatory behavior is something that we observe a lot in nature and a lot of our technology builds on systems that oscillate. If we want to build mathematical models of such processes, we will need a mathematical framework that can mimic this sort of behavior. It turns out that ODEs are very suitable for this.

\paragraph{A Single Second Order ODE}
The quintessential mathematical description of an oscillation is the sine function $f(x) = a \sin(\omega x + \varphi)$. We have already included some parameters for flexibility: $a$ for the overall amplitude, $\omega$ to control the frequency and $\varphi$ for the initial phase at $x=0$. We have already seen that such sinusoidal functions happen to arise as solutions of simple ODEs like $f = -f''$. This equation is called a linear second order differential equation. It is linear because it does not contain any products between $f$ and its derivatives. It is second order because the highest derivative of $f$ that appears in the equation is the second derivative. ...TBC...

\paragraph{A System of Two First Order ODEs}
There is a canonical way, i.e. a recipe, by way of which it is possible to re-express an ODE of any order $n$ as a system of $n$ first order differential equations. This form is a quite convenient canonical form for solving an ODE numerically. It happens to the form that most (if not all) generic numerical ODE solvers expect their input. So, if we want to use numerical solvers, we need to be familiar with that form and we need to know how to produce it, when the ODE is given to us in a different form.
...TBC...

% Maybe treat the conversion between single high-order ODE and system of 1st order ODEs in a different section - the conversion is not limited to linear ODEs.

\paragraph{A Single First Order Complex ODE}
We have seen a second order ODE can produce oscillatory behavior and that a system of two first order ODEs can reproduce that behavior as well. It seems like we need either a second derivative or two equations but there is actually a third way to produce oscillatory behavior with ODEs that requires only single first order ODE. The key is to allow the coefficient to be imaginary. If we have an ODE in a complex variable, that variable actually has two parts - the real and imaginary part - and they in which these parts interact resembles the way our two variables from our system of two ODEs interact, as we will see....TBC...

\subsection{Theory of Linear ODEs}
For the important subset of linear ODEs, we actually do have a full blown analytic solution theory. Much of this theory will closely parallel and build upon the solution theory of linear systems of equations that we know from linear algebra. ...TBC...

\subsubsection{Linear ODEs with Constant Coefficients}
We have seen how a second order linear ODE with constant coefficients could model decaying (or damped) oscillations and the range of possible behaviors also included pure oscillations and pure decay processes as special edge cases as well. What sort of behavior we will see depends on the coefficients. Exponential growth (with or without oscillation) is actually a third kind of behavior that can be produced. We will now look into what happens when we allow higher order ODEs or, equivalently, systems of more than two first order ODEs. What we will discover may be on the one hand disappointing: We will not see any fundamentally new sorts of behavior. These higher order systems will exhibit behaviors that can be expressed as superpositions (i.e. weighted sums) of the behavior that we already saw. But that may be - on the other hand - also satisfying: we already have the mathematical machinery to fully understand that kind of behavior. For linear ODEs with constant coefficients, there is a full blown analytic theory about their solutions. That theory actually extends even a bit further to non-constant coefficients, i.e. "coefficients" that can be functions of the independent variable. But let's treat the simpler case of constant coefficients first. ...TBC...

% The resulting sortd of behavior is actually not something fundamentally new - we'll just see superpositions of oscillations

-solving an ODE can be seen as a certain generalization of solving an integral - explain how
-give ODE of damped oscillator: f + a_1 f' + a_2 f'' = 0. For $a_1 = 0, a_2 = 1$ we get the ODE for exp, for $a_1 = -1, a_2 = 0$ we get the ODE for sin.
