\section{Infinite Products}
Recall the product sign from page \pageref{Sec:SumsAndProducts} and let's combine that idea with the idea of taking infinite sum embodied in equation (\ref{Eq:InfiniteSum}). But now we want to take an infinite product instead of a sum. That is, we want to make sense of expressions like this:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:InfiniteProduct}
P = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{k=0}^n a_k
  = \prod_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k
\end{equation}
where, again, $(a_k)$ is some given sequence. Here, "given" means that we'll typically have a formula to calculate $a_k$ for a given $k$, i.e. we have a formula in which $k$ appears that computes $a_k$. ...TBC...

\subsection{Convergence}
Just as we did with infinite sums (aka series), we are interested in the question whether or not a given infinite product converges to a finite number. One could perhaps guess, that the definition of convergence for infinite products is entirely analogous to the definition of convergence for infinite sums, namely, that a product converges if and only if the sequence of partial products converges. However, the actual definition is a bit more subtle and takes into account the special role of the number zero for multiplication. The actual definition of convergence ensures that a convergent product is zero if and only if at least one of its factors is zero. A necessary condition for an infinite product to converge is that the individual factors must approach one. That is analogous to the requirement that summands must approach zero in infinite sums.  ...TBC...

\subsubsection{Some Examples}
To get a feeling for how infinite products may converge or diverge, we'll now look at a couple of simple examples.

\paragraph{Divergence to Infinity}
Consider the following finite product:
\begin{equation}
 p_n = \prod_{k=2}^n  \left(1 + \frac{1}{k} \right)
     = \prod_{k=2}^n  \left(\frac{k + 1}{k} \right)
     = \frac{3}{2}   \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac{6}{5} 
       \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{n}{n-1} \cdot \frac{n+1}{n}
     = \frac{n+1}{2}
\end{equation}
It simplified so nicely because we could cancel the 3 in the numerator of the first factor with the denominator 3 in the 2nd factor and so on. We are dealing with a telescopic product and the only non-canceling numerator is the last one given by $n+1$ and the only non-canceling denominator is the first one given by $2$. So far, there is nothing infinite going on - it's all just a finite product. Now we look at what happens when we let $n$ approach infinity. Clearly, $p_n = \frac{n+1}{2}$ also diverges to infinity in this case. So we can say that:
\begin{equation}
 P = \prod_{k=2}^{\infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k} \right)
   = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} p_n 
   = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{k=2}^n  \left(1 + \frac{1}{k} \right)
   = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n+1}{2} 
   = \infty
\end{equation}
The infinite variant of the product diverges to infinity. The individual factors in the product approach 1 from above - but not quickly enough to lead to a convergent infinite product. This is somewhat analogous to the divergence of the harmonic series where we sum terms of the form $\frac{1}{n}$. These terms approach zero but not fast enough to make the infinite sum convergent.


\paragraph{Divergence to Zero}
Now let's consider the finite product:
\begin{equation}
 p_n = \prod_{k=2}^n  \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)
     = \prod_{k=2}^n  \left(\frac{k - 1}{k} \right)
     = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{5} 
       \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{n-2}{n-1} \cdot \frac{n-1}{n}
     = \frac{1}{n}
\end{equation}
The only difference is that now we subtract $\frac{1}{k}$ from $1$ in the factors instead of adding it like in the product before. The factors now approach one from below rather than from above. Again we are dealing with a telescopic product that simplifies nicely. In this case, it simplifies to $p_n = \frac{1}{n}$. Most of the numbers from $1$ to $n$ appear in the numerator and the denominator and cancel each other out. The only ones that remain are $1$ in the numerator and $n$ in the denominator. If we now again let $n$ approach infinity to turn the finite into an infinite product, then $p_n = \frac{1}{n}$ clearly approaches zero:
\begin{equation}
 P = \prod_{k=2}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)
   = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} p_n 
   = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{k=2}^n  \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)
   = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n} 
   = 0
\end{equation}
That is so even though none of the individual factors is zero - in fact, the smallest factor that occurs is $\frac{1}{2}$. If we would be dealing with an infinite sum rather than a product, we would consider such a sum convergent - namely, it would converge to zero. With infinite products, however, the terminology is a bit different. We say that the product \emph{diverges to zero}. 

\medskip
Q: What about a product of the form $P = \prod_{k=2}^{\infty} \left(1 + \frac{(-1)^k}{k} \right)$? We'll alternatingly get factors that are greater and less than 1. Will that converge like the alternating harmonic series does?

% What about a product with alternating signs in the offset:
%   P = \prod_{k=2}^{\infty} \left(1 + \frac{-1^k}{k} \right)
% we'll alternatingly get factors that are greater and less than 1.

%Such a product is not considered to be convergent and instead is said to \emph{diverge to zero}.

%\begin{equation}
% P = \prod_{k=2}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)
%   = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{k=2}^n  \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)
%\end{equation}

%  p_n = \prod_{k=2}^n  \left(1 + \frac{1}{k} \right)
% the factors are now (1 + 1/k) rather than a (1 - 1/k). It's also a telescopic product - but it
% diverges to infinity

\paragraph{Convergence to a Non-Zero Value}
Recall that the harmonic series, i.e. the infinite sum over terms of the form $\frac{1}{k}$ was divergent but the sum of the reciprocals of the squares $\frac{1}{k^2}$ was convergent. This was so because the terms approached zero faster than in the $\frac{1}{k}$ case. Let's try to let the factors in our infinite product approach 1 faster by using factors of the form $1 - \frac{1}{k^2}$ rather than $1 - \frac{1}{k}$. So, we'll consider the product:
\begin{equation}
 p_n = \prod_{k=2}^n  \left(1 - \frac{1}{k^2} \right)
     = \prod_{k=2}^n  \left(\frac{k^2-1}{k^2} \right)
     = \frac{n+1}{2n}
\end{equation}
The last step is not supposed to be obvious but it can be guessed by looking at the first couple of products and then be proved by induction.  If we again let $n$ approach infinity to turn the finite into an infinite product, then this time $p_n$ approaches a nonzero value, namely $\frac{1}{2}$.
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:ProdOneMinusOneOverKSquared}
P = \prod_{k=2}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{k^2} \right)
  = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{k=2}^{n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{k^2} \right)
  = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} p_n
  = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n+1}{2n}
  = \frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}
So, we can say that the infinite product converges to $\frac{1}{2}$. Now we are getting closer to the behavior that we want to eventually call convergent. If the limit of the sequence of partial products approaches some \emph{finite value} and that value is \emph{not zero}, then we are certainly justified to call the product convergent. In some sources, that is indeed the definition of a convergent product: the limit of of partial products must converge to a finite nonzero value. We are aiming for a somewhat more liberal definition here, though - one that allows us to also call a product convergent when the value is zero due to one ore more of the factors being zero.

\subsubsection{The Special Role of Zero}
In the context of multiplication and products, the number zero has a special role - it annihilates everything. If just a single factor in a (finite or infinite) product is zero, then the whole product is zero as well. It is also the only real (and complex) number that has no multiplicative inverse.

\paragraph{Convergence to Zero}
We have seen an example of an infinite product that had zero as a result even though none of its individual factors was zero. We called that product \emph{divergent to zero}. Not all products that have zero as result are said to "diverge" to zero, though. Some are also just zero because one or more of the factors is itself zero. Such products may also \emph{converge to zero}. To see what the difference between the two notions is, consider the infinite product:
\begin{equation}
P = \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{k^2} \right)
\end{equation}
It looks almost like the one defined in (\ref{Eq:ProdOneMinusOneOverKSquared}) which was convergent to the number $\frac{1}{2}$. But our product here has a small but important difference. The index $k$ now starts at $1$ rather than $2$. That has the effect that the very first factor in the product evaluates to zero. This, of course, turns the value of the whole product to zero as well. We annihilated an otherwise convergent product by introducing a single factor of zero. In the definition of convergence that we are aiming for, we want to still call such a product convergent. We will say that it \emph{converges to zero}. In general, we want to call a product that evaluates to zero as convergent to zero, when its infinite tail converges to a nonzero number but in an initial section, there may be finitely many factors of zero.  ...TBC...

%\begin{equation}
% p_n = \prod_{k=2}^n  \left(1 - \frac{1}{k^2} \right)
%     = \prod_{k=2}^n  \left(\frac{k^2-1}{k^2} \right)
%     = \frac{n+1}{2n}
%\end{equation}
%The last step is not supposed to be obvious but it can be guessed by looking at the first couple of products and then be proved by induction.  If we again let $n$ approach infinity to turn the finite into an infinite product, then this time $p_n$ approaches a nonzero value, namely $\frac{1}{2}$.
%\begin{equation}
%P = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{k=2}^{n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{k^2} \right)
%  = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} p_n
%  = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n+1}{2n}
%  = \frac{1}{2}
%\end{equation}
%So, we can say that the infinite product converges to $\frac{1}{2}$. If we now consider the product in which the index does start at $1$ rather than at $2$, we get an initial first factor of zero which collapses the whole product to zero as well. This product has a value of zero because one of the factors happened to be zero - but its tail end converged to a nonzero finite number. Only in such a case, we want to say that the product \emph{converges to zero}. [VERIFY!]

\subsubsection{Definition of Convergence}
OK - we now have all our desiderata in place and are now ready to craft the general definition of convergence for products. We call an infinite product convergent, if ...TBC...

% Some authors also just flatly disallow a convergent product to have a value of zero and call a product convergent if and only if the sequence of partial products converges to a nonzero value. With such a definition "convergence to zero" is not a thing. There's only divergence to zero, divergence to infinity and convergence to a finite nonzero value. But maybe we need to allow convergence to zero if we wnat to formulate certain theorems in a convenient way - those that say: the product converges if and only if the sum of ... converges

\subsection{Functions Expressed via Products}
Some of our favorite functions have expressions based on infinite products. 

% ToDo: 
% -Explain how one can come up with a product representation of a given function. 
% -If we know the zero-crossings/roos r_k  of the function, we may try to express f(x) as
%    f(x) = c  \prod_{k=0}^{$\infty$} (x - r_k)
%  where c is an overall scaling factor that somehow needs to figured out. Maybe it could make sense
%  to give each linear factor (x - r_k) its own scaling factor and use factors of the form
%  c_k (x - r_k)  and maybe try to express the factor in the form of (1 - x_k / r_k) because we 
%  generally like factors of the form (1 + something).
% -Maybe if we have a MacLaurin or Taylor series of the function given:
%  f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + ...
%  we can factor out one linear factor (x - r_k) at a time?

\paragraph{Sine}
A nice infinite product representation of the sine function was found be Euler and is given by:
\begin{equation}
 \sin(x) = x \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( 1 - \frac{x^2}{k^2 \pi^2}  \right)
\end{equation}
He discovered this formula in the course of solving the so called Basel problem which is to find the value of the infinite sum $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2}$. Euler found the value of this sum to be $\frac{\pi^2}{6}$ and his investigations led also to the definition of the famous Riemann zeta function (VERIFY!). By evaluating this formula at $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$, one obtains:
\begin{equation}
 1 = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{4 k^2}  \right)
   = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{4 k^2 - 1}{4 k^2}  \right)
   = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{(2k-1)(2k+1)}{(2k)^2}  \right)   
\end{equation}
and solving that for $\pi$ gives:
\begin{equation}
\pi = 2 \cdot \prod_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{(2k)^2 }{(2k-1)(2k+1)} \right)   
\end{equation}
which is known as the \emph{Wallis product} representation of $\pi$. Due to its slow convergence, the formula useless for practical computation of $\pi$, though. But it's an interesting factoid nonetheless.

-The definition of convergence for products is not the obvious one and quite subtle. There is
 a notion of convergence to zeor as well as divergence to zero.

-For a product to converge, the individual factors must approach 1 (necessary but not sufficient
 condition, I guess)

-If all a_n > 0, we can just take the logarithm of the product to transform it into a sum. The 
 product converges  iff the sum converges
-If all a_n >= 0, the poduct over (1 + a_n) converges iff the sum over a_n converges

-Give Euler's product form of cosine. Look up the zetamath channel. IIRC, it has a good video 
 about this

Is it true that for convergent products with

-I guess, that may be the case in case of convergence to a nonzero value. But if P converges
 (or diverges) to zero, then maybe 1/P diverges to infinity which would make sense.
