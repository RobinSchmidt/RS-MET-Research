\section{Infinite Products}
Recall the product sign from page \pageref{Sec:SumsAndProducts} and let's combine that idea with the idea of taking infinite sum embodied in equation (\ref{Eq:InfiniteSum}). But now we want to take an infinite product instead of a sum. That is, we want to make sense of expressions like this:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:InfiniteProduct}
P = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{k=0}^n a_k
  = \prod_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k
\end{equation}
where, again, $(a_k)$ is some given sequence. Here, "given" means that we'll typically have a formula to calculate $a_k$ for a given $k$, i.e. we a formula in which $k$ appears that computes $a_k$. ...TBC...
