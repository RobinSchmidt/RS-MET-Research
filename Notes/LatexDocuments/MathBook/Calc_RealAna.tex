\section{Real Analysis} 



\begin{comment}


Make a section about "Real Analysis". There, give all the weird functions that are used as
(counter)examples.

Maybe try to define important calculus ideas purely in terms of rational numbers. There will be problems. For example, certain sequences of numbers may converge to an irrational limit. Point them out by examples (maybe e, pi, sqrt(2), ...) to justify the necessity of introducing the real numbers.

the real numbers are stranger than you think

-The Cantor set is uncountable. That's very counterintuitive because it appears to be much sparser 
 than the rationals which are countable. Both have Lebesgue measure zero.
-Measure is about how a set is distributed


Yes, you can do induction on the real numbers! #SoME4
