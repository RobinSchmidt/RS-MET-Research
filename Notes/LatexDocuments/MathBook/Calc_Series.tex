\section{Series}

\subsection{Sequences}
A sequence can be defined as a function from the natural into the real numbers: $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The input can be seen as an index for an element of the sequence. Sometimes it is more convenient to restrict the domain to the positive natural numbers, i.e. consider functions $f: \mathbb{N}^+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. You will find both definitions for sequences in the literature. Here, we will mostly use the former and I will give a special disclaimer when the latter is used. Some example sequences are:
\begin{equation}
 a_n = \frac{1}{n},      \quad
 a_n = \frac{(-1)^n}{n}, \quad 
 a_n = \frac{1}{n^2},    \quad
 a_n = \frac{1}{2^n},   
\end{equation}
The first three examples can only be meaningfully defined as functions from the positive naturals into the reals because otherwise we would have a division by zero for the first (actually zero-th) element. For the last, plugging in $n=0$ poses no problem because $2^0=1$.

\subsection{Infinite Sums aka Series}
When we have a given sequence $(a_n)$, we can use it to define a new sequence, namely the sequence of its partial sums. Let's call that sequence $(s_n)$. Its $n$th element is given by the sum over all elements up to $n$ of our input sequence $(a_n)$:
\begin{equation}
 s_n = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k
\end{equation}
Just like with any sequence, we can ask whether this sequence of partial sums converges or diverges when we let $n$ approach infinity. What we have then created is an infinite sum. Such infinite sums have a special name: they are called \emph{series}.
