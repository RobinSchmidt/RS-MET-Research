\chapter{Combinatorics}
Combinatorics is concerned with counting all the possible ways to do a certain thing. This "thing" could be something like "select $k$ elements from a set of size $n$" or "create all possible acylic graphs of size $n$" or "find all ways to express a natural number $n$ as sum of smaller numbers" or "find all the possible ways that 5 rolls of a die could result in a sum less than 17". Things like that. The common theme is to count the number of different possibilities to do that thing. The result of such a counting tally will always be a discrete quantity or, more specifically, a natural number. Combinatorics lays a lot of groundwork for other mathematical fields such as set theory, graph theory, number theory and probability theory. The examples of possible questions were taken from these fields - in that order.
