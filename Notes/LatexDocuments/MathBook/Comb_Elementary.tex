% Weitz pg 177 has also a nice introdcution

\paragraph{Permutations}
Let's say that we have $n$ different (i.e. distinguishable) objects and we want to know, how many ways there are, to put these objects into a different order. For example, the possible orders for the $3$ objects $a,b,c$ are $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$. These are $6$ different orders. We call these different orderings of a number of $n$ different objects \emph{permutations}. The term "permute" means something like "reorder" where identity (i.e. do-nothing) reordering also counts as trivial edge case (as is typical in math). The number of \emph{permutations} of $n$ distinguishable objects is given by:
\begin{equation}
P_n = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot n = n!
\end{equation}
This is easy to understand when we recognize that there are exactly $n$ different ways to put an element into the first position because we haven $n$ elements to choose from. Then, there remain $n-1$ different ways to put some other element into the second position and so on because after the first element has been chosen, we have $n-1$ elements left to choose from. And so on. We get $n\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdot\ldots\cdot1$ ways all in all. I stressed the point that the objects need to be distinguishable. This is the usual case when the objects are elements of a mathematical \emph{set} because set elements are by definition distinguishable. There is a more general notion of a \emph{multiset} in which there may be indistinguishable objects. If the $n$ objects are not all distinguishable such that they fall into $k$ equivalence classes of sizes $m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_k$ with $m_1 + m_2 + \ldots + m_k = n$, then there are:
\begin{equation}
P_n^{(m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_k)} 
= \frac{n!}{m_1! m_2! \ldots m_k!} 
= \binom{n}{m_1,m_2,\ldots, m_k}
\end{equation}
distinguishable permutations. These ares sometimes called \emph{multiset permutations} or \emph{permutations with repetition} [VERIFY!]. The numbers $m_i$ are called the \emph{multiplicities}. The quantity is also called the multinomial coefficient and it is a generalization of the binomial coefficient "$n$-choose-$k$" and the notation on the right hand side is a corresponding generalization of the usual binomial coefficient notation $\binom{n}{k}$. ...TBC..

\paragraph{Combinations}
Imagine we have a set of size $n$ and we are asked how many different subsets of size $k$ we can form from this set. That is: how many different ways are there to choose $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements. It doesn't matter in which order we chose the elements - as long as the total set of chosen elements is the same, our created subset is considered to be the same (remember that in sets, order doesn't matter - it isn't even a thing\footnote{Unless you \emph{define} one order \emph{on top} of the set - but a set all by itself does not have a notion of order built into it.}). We call these different subsets of size $k$ of a given set of size $n$ \emph{combinations} or, more specifically, $k$-combinations. The number of possible $k$-combinations from a set of size $n$ is given by the binomial coefficient:
\begin{equation}
C_n^k = \binom{n}{k} 
      = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} 
      = \frac{n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \ldots \cdot (n-k+1)}{k!}
      = \frac{\prod_{m=n-k+1}^{n} m}{k!}
\end{equation}
which is, for this reason, typically pronounced as "$n$-choose-$k$". ...TBC...

\paragraph{Variations}
%The number of \emph{variations} of $n$ distinguishable objects is given by:
\begin{equation}
V_n^k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} 
      = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \ldots \cdot (n-k+1) 
      = \prod_{m=n-k+1}^{n} m
\end{equation}
