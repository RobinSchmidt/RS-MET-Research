\chapter{Discrete Calculus}
Calculus, in the most commonly used sense of the word, refers to the field of mathematics that deals with derivatives, integrals, differential equations, sequences and series expansions. In a broader sense \emph{a} calculus is a system of rules for doing calculations. The so called \emph{discrete calculus} is a calculus that is analogous to the usual differential and integral calculus, just that we do not go the limiting step where some quantity (like a $\Delta x$ or $h$, say) approaches zero. Instead, our $h$ remains a fixed finite (i.e. non-infinitesimal) value that is chosen upfront - usually taken to be $1$. It turns out that you can always reformulate the problem into a form where $h = 1$ such it doesn't really matter which value you choose, and choosing $1$ turns out to be most convenient. ...TBC...

% Calculus of sequences, i.e. of functions N -> R

% Examples: lambda calculus, residue


\section{Difference Calculus}
Difference calculus is the part of discrete calculus that is analogous to the usual differential calculus. ...TBC...

%ToDo: define forward and backward difference, mention connection to numerical approximation of derivatives (maybe mention the central difference although it plays no big role in difference calculus)

\section{Summation Calculus}
Summation calculus is the part of discrete calculus that is analogous to the usual integral calculus. ...TBC...


%\section{Function Approximation}
% -develope the Newton-Gregory formula as analogon for Taylor series



\section{Difference Equations}
The calculus of difference equations is the part of discrete calculus that is analogous to the calculus of differential equations. ...TBC...

Why don't they teach Newton's calculus of 'What comes next?'
