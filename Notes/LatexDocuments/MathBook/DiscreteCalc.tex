\chapter{Discrete Calculus}
Calculus, in the most commonly used sense of the word, refers to the field of mathematics that deals with derivatives, integrals, differential equations, sequences and series expansions. In a broader sense \emph{a} calculus is a system of rules for doing calculations. The so called \emph{discrete calculus} is a calculus that is analogous to the usual differential and integral calculus, just that we do not go the limiting step where some quantity (like a $\Delta x$ or $h$, say) approaches zero. Instead, our $h$ remains a fixed finite (i.e. non-infinitesimal) value that is chosen upfront - usually taken to be $1$. It turns out that you can always reformulate the problem into a form where $h = 1$ such it doesn't really matter which value you choose, and choosing $1$ turns out to be most convenient. ...TBC...

%\paragraph{Evaluating Sums at Non-Integers}
\paragraph{Interpolation of Sums}
Suppose we are given a function $f(x)$ and suppose that for some order $m$, the difference $\Delta^m$ of $f$ vanishes for large values of $x$ such that $\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \Delta^m f(x) = 0$. We want to evaluate the sum $S(x)$ defined via $S(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{x} f(k)$. We have suggestively used $x$ as variable name to indicate that we want to evaluate the sum at non integers. But the $x$ occurs as upper summation limit so we can use the defining formula for evaluating $S$ only for integer $x$. The following formula provides a nice, smooth and "natural" interpolation for $S(x)$ for non-integer values of $x$:
\begin{equation}
S(x) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} 
\left(   \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \left(f(k) - f(x+k) \right) 
       + \sum_{k=1}^{m} \binom{x}{k} \Delta^{k-1} f(n)  \right)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\binom{x}{k} = \frac{x (x-1) (x-2) \ldots (x-(k-1)) }{k!}
\end{equation}
...TBC...Explain where the formula comes from, give some examples.

% Maybe move the definition of binomial coeffs for real x into the early section about binomial coeffs. Maybe also give a generalization for (n,k) where k is real and n is still integer. Finally, give one where both are real. Maybe it can use the product function \Pi(x) that reduces to the factorial when x is natural. Then use the formula that defines binomial coeffs in terms of the product function. Like binom(x,y) = prod(x) * prod(x-y) / prod(y). Maybe express it in terms of the logarithms: log(binom(x,y)) = log(prod(x)) + log(prod(x-y)) - log(prod(y)) to tame the intermediate numbers to avoid overflow in numeric computations


% Q: Does it also work when we define $S(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{x} f(k)$? It seems more natural to me to let start k at 0 rather than 1.

% Q: Can the formula be applied to interpolate functions that are not defined via sums? Looks like we could just write an arbitrary function as sum of its first difference and then apply the formula to that. That means, for any given function S(x), just set f(x) = \Delta S(x) and then apply the above formula. That just increases the power of the Delta in the formula by 1: f becomes \Delta S, and $\Delta^{k-1} f$ becomes $\Delta^{k} S$

% ToDo: implement it numerically

% They are actually also known as recurrence relations. They are a ceratin type of functional equations, I think.
