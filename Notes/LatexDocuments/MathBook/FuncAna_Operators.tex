\section{Operators}

-linear operators: integral, differential, projection (best approximation from a subspace), multiply by fixed function, shift, rotate?, solutions to ODE as operator? driving-function goes in, solution comes out?
-eigenfunctions and eigenvalues
-adjoint operators - how to compute (see videos/notes/books by Nathan Kutz), something with integration by parts
-solving operator equations, Fredholm alternative
-seems like in inifinite dimensional spaces, linear operators can be unbounded (how so? - find example) and the bounded linear operators are precisely those that give rise to continuous mappings -> figure out, this seems to be an important theme
