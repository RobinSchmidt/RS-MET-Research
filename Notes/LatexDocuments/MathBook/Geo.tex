\chapter{Geometry}
Geometry is the study of shapes that live in a certain space. That "space" can be the well known 3D space that we happen to live in or just a 2D subspace of it, such as a plane or the surface of a sphere or torus or whatever other 3D object. It can also be a higher dimensional space that we can't easily visualize anymore such as the 4D spacetime that we actually happen to live in.
