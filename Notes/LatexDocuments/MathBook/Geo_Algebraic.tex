\section{Algebraic Geometry}
Algebraic geometry investigates the sets of zeros of multivariate polynomials and the geometrical shapes that are defined by these zero sets. Consider as example the bivariate polynomial $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - r^2$ for some given constant $r$. Those points $(x,y)$ in the $xy$-plane for which this function produces zero as output define a geometric shape - in this case, a circle of radius $r$ centered at the origin. You can have multiple simultaneous equations that must be equal to zero and of course, you can also have more than two input variables. It's also possible to consider complex solutions, in fact, that's the more typical setting. In general, these sets of solutions to polynomial equations are called "algebraic varieties" and these are the main subject of interest in algebraic geometry.

\medskip
Besides the circle, all conic sections, i.e. sets of solutions of equations of the form $0 = A x^2 + B y^2 + C x y + D x + E y + F$, fall into this category. The set of solutions of $y^2 = x^3 + a x + b$ for some given values $a,b$ is called an "elliptic curve". These are not to be confused with actual ellipses, which are special cases of conic sections. Rather, elliptic curves represent a canonical form of the generalization of conic sections up to degree 3 (verify!).

%simple examples: conic sections, elliptic curves, cassini curves, lemniskate

% important questions: find a (rational) parameterization, is the zero set a manifold? what topological invariants does it have?

% Bezout's Theorem

\medskip
It is also possible to work in the field of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ rather than in the field of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ or even in finite fields such as $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for a given prime number $p$. ...tbc..

Fun fact: algebraic geometry and geometric algebra are two fields of mathematics that have nothing to do with each other. Isn't that weird? I really wonder, how connections between these fields could look like. Maybe we could start by interpreting the variables in the equations as multivectors instead of real or complex numbers? I have no idea but I think there just \emph{should} be some connection!


\subsection{Elliptic Curves}
\subsubsection{Elliptic Curves} 
% asterisk means: can be skipped on first reading
Here, we will consider a certain subset of bivariate polynomial equations that turned out to be in the sweet spot between being enough to actually tackle them and complex enough to allow for some interesting features. I'm talking about the so called elliptic curves. But didn't we already talk about ellipses as one particular type of conic section? Yeah - an \emph{elliptic curve} is actually \emph{not an ellipse} but rather the set of solutions of a bivariate polynomial equation of degree 3. ToDo: explain etymology if the term

\paragraph{Group Structure $\star$} % asterisk means: can be skipped on first reading
The set of rational points on such an elliptic has an interesting property: together with a suitably defined binary operation between these points, they form an algebraic structure known as commutative group. That basically means that we can plug two rational points into our operation and the operation will produce another rational point on the curve. In the context of elliptic curve theory, this operation is usually denoted  with $+$ and called addition - but it is \emph{not} just the regular vector addition. ...TBC...

\subsection{The Abstract Perspective $\star$}
This section can be skipped on a first reading of the book. It references rather advanced ideas that are properly introduced only (much) later - specifically \emph{ring theory} from abstract algebra.




\subsubsection{Polynomial Rings}
Algebraic geometry, when viewed as the business of trying to find the set of solutions of multivariate polynomial equations, is actually about quite intuitive ideas. However, when you open a textbook on algebraic geometry written for real mathematicians, you will discover that it will talk about very abstract ideas that sound like they have nothing to do with geometry. In the abstract algebra perspective of algebraic geometry, we consider quotient rings of polynomial rings. For example, in 2D, when we have a bivariate polynomial like $p(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1$, we will consider the ring $R = \mathbb{R}[x,y] \setminus (x^2 + y^2 - 1)$ and analyze its properties with the arcane machinery of ring theory. 

% Is this the ring of all polynomials that are zero on p? Or is it the ring of all polynomials
% but we are allowed only to plug in values for which p(x,y) = 0 i.e. only points on the unit
% circle?
% Our ring $R$ is the ring of all polynomials $q(x,y)$ that

%  can be skipped on a first reading

% -Maybe bring a 1D example: take a polynomial like p(x) = (x+2)*(x-3) = x^2 - x - 6 with 
%  roots at {-2,3}
% -Consider the ring R[x] \ p(x)
% -It is the ring of all polynomils that has zeros at -2,3. The set of all these polynomials
%  is considered to form an eqivalence class.
% -Any polynomial that is zero at -2 and 3 must have p(x) as factor, so any polynomial with p
%  as factor is considered to be equivalent...right...or wrong?

%% points (x,y) for which

-conic sections in 2D and 3D, classification
-elliptic curves
-lemniskate, contour plots
-polynomials with integer/rational coeffs -> integer and rational solutions -> elliptic curve cryptography
-what about allowing more general classes of functions?
-what about multiple simultaneous equations - what does that imply for the dimensionality of the solution set?
-what are important features of the solution sets? connectedness?

-seems like differential geometry deals with parameteric representations and algebraic geometry with implicit representations of geometric shapes (manifolds?)
-is there a way to convert between these representations? ..yeah...this seems to be actually a difficult research area

-write a c++ function that takes in an implicit function f(x,y) = 0 and spits out a vector of vectors of 2D points (the outer vector is because we may have multiple curves), this can then be converted into svg or tikz code (via suitable code-generators that take as input the coordinate vectors)
-with this code, generate tikz figures for elliptic curves, maybe x^2 + y^3 + k = 0 for different values of k
