\section{Analytic Geometry}
Analytic geometry is about representing the positions of points within space by numbers and doing calculations with these numbers. These numbers are called "coordinates" and are to be understood with respect to a given coordinate system which has to be chosen beforehand. From points, more complex objects like lines, planes, shapes, etc. can be made up and we are interested in computing things like the distance of a point from a line or plane etc.. The term "analytic" is, in my humble opinion, a bit misleading here because "analysis" is usually taken to be a more rigorous version of calculus but in analytic geometry, we typically do more basic vector- and matrix-algebra stuff and the more calculusy things are usually tackled later in "differential" geometry. However, "analytic" geometry, just like "elementary" geometry, is also mostly a bunch of formulas that are useful for creating more complex geometric algorithms. The main distinctive feature is that these formulas will typically involve representations of our shapes in terms of vectors of coordinates. This is actually the more typical representation we use in a computer, at least in the context of graphics but also for physical simulations. In this context, the points are also often called "vertices" and they can be represented by vectors. Conceptually, a point is actually not the same thing as a vector. A point is just a location in space and it doesn't seem to be a meaningful idea to add two locations in space together, for example. A vector, on the other hand, is meant to encode a length and direction (of movement) and it does indeed make geometric sense to add a vector to a point to get another point. In practice, however, this distinction is rarely made and points are just identified with their position vectors, i.e. vectors that go from the origin of the coordinate system to the point. Vectors are things that we can freely add together anyway and the result will always be another vector.

\subsection{Lines}
Given a point $\mathbf{p}$ and a nonzero vector $\mathbf{v}$, both elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we can consider the following set of points:
\begin{equation}
 L 
 =
 \{\mathbf{p} + \mathbb{R} \mathbf{v} \} 
 = 
 \{ \mathbf{p} + t \mathbf{v}, \; t \in \mathbb{R} \}
\end{equation}
This set of points represents a line in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The expression in the middle is just a shorthand notation for the expression on the right. Multiplying the vector $\mathbf{v}$ by the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ is meant in the sense that we take $\mathbf{v}$ and multiply it by every possible real number $t \in \mathbb{R}$. This line $L$ goes through the point $\mathbf{p}$ and has a direction of $\mathbf{v}$. The line is given in the so called \emph{parametric form}\footnote{Well, I think, for a parametric form, one would more commonly write out a separate equation for each coordinate if $n$ is known and small enough like $2$ or $3$. For general unknown $n$, this vector form can be seen as a more abstract way of writing down a parametric form.} with the parameter $t$. It's also called the \emph{vector form}. We can imagine that, as $t$ sweeps through the real numbers, a point sweeps along the line. For each value of $t$, we obtain some point on the line by just plugging the value $t$ into the formula. With $t=0$, we are at $\mathbf{p}$. With $t=1$, we are at $\mathbf{p + v}$. With $t=\frac{1}{2}$, we are at $\mathbf{p} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{v}$ which is exactly halfway between $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{p + v}$. And so on. The vector form is not the only way to define a line. One can also use two (distinct) points $\mathbf{p}_1,\mathbf{p}_2$ on the line and two real numbers $t_1, t_2$ that satisfy $t_1 + t_2 = 1$ and express the line as the set of points:
\begin{equation}
 L = \{ t_1 \mathbf{p}_1 + t_2 \mathbf{p}_2,  \quad t_1, t_2 \in \mathbb{R}, t_1 + t_2 = 1 \}
\end{equation}
This is called a \emph{two point form}. It may also be called a representation in terms of \emph{barycentric coordinates}, although that terminology is less commonly used for lines - it's more commonly used for planes that are defined by 3 points or $n$-dimensional hyperplanes that are defined by $n+1$ points, but it is the proper $1D$ analog. You may wonder why we introduce the variable $t_2$ and don't just use $1 - t_1$ instead (and then drop the index altogether). The reason is that this would work only for the 1D case, i.e. the line, but writing it like above will readily generalize to barycentric representations of higher dimensional objects. Yet another way to define a line is by means of an implicit equation of the form...TBC....TODO: give other forms of a line (implicit, explicit, etc.), mention that it can be generalized from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to vector spaces over any field - the complex numbers are interesting in the context of algebraic geometry, give the ways to convert between the different forms.

\subsection{Planes}
Given a point $\mathbf{p}$ and two linearly independent\footnote{Linear independence implies that both must be nonzero.} vectors $\mathbf{v, w}$, consider the following set of points:
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{p} + \mathbb{R} \mathbf{v}  + \mathbb{R} \mathbf{w}
 \quad = \quad
 \mathbf{p} + s \mathbf{v} + t \mathbf{w}, \; s,t \in \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
This set of points represents a plane in $\mathbb{R}^n$. 

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Hyperplanes}
After having seen lines and planes, the pattern continues. We can take some fixed point $\mathbf{p}$ together with a set of $k$ linearly independent vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k$ and consider the set:
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{p} + \sum_{i=0}^{k} t_i \mathbf{v}_i, \; t_i \in \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
This set defines a $k$-dimensional hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^n$ where $k < n$. Well, we could perhaps allow $k=n$ as edge case as well, but then we would just get the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$ and that's not interesting. We are interested in substructures of $\mathbb{R}^n$. But $k > n$ does really not make any sense at all, not even as edge case, because then we can't even find a set of $k$ linearly independent vectors anymore.
