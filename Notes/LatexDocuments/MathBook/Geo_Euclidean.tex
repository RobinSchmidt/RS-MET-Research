\section{Elementary Geometry}
Elementary geometry is about basic geometric features of basic shapes in the 2D plane or 3D space such as lengths, areas, volumes, angles, etc. of triangles, quadrilaterals, circles etc.. It's mostly a catalog of laws, formulas or algorithms to compute quantities of interest given some other quantities. For example, if we know two angles of a triangle, there's a simple formula to compute the third. If we know the locations of the vertices of a triangle and we want to know its area, there's a formula for that, too (in fact, actually multiple formulas). If we know the length of a side of a triangle and its two adjacent angles, there's an algorithm to compute the third angle and the lengths of the two other sides. Things like that. These formulas and algorithms are "elementary" in the sense that they are used as building blocks in more complex, higher level geometric algorithms or derivations. For example, one might be interested in the area of a more complicated polygon in the plane. One way to compute it (not necessarily the best, though) involves splitting it into a bunch of triangles, computing their areas and adding them up. The formulas, laws and algorithms of elementary geometry are well suited for treating them as recipes. There are a lot of them and it's pointless to try to memorize them all. Deriving all these formulas is not necessarily easy or obvious. This is not, what "elementary" means (quite generally in math). It typically involves drawing pictures, recognizing visually that certain angles or lengths are the same, then proving that this must always be the case, often by drawing auxiliary lines in non-obvious places which may involve some ingenuity and inspiration. We won't bother with that. At the end of the process stands a neat formula and we are here to reap the crops, not to sow the seeds and grow them. For us, it's enough to know that these formulas exist and where to look them up, if needed. Or better yet: implement them once and for all in our favorite programming language and then just call the functions from higher-level code for the rest of our life without ever again needing to worry about how that low-level stuff is actually being done. 

\subsection{Angles}
Angles are a way to measure an amount of rotation. Imagine standing on straight line extending forward from your position. Now turn a little bit to the left and imagine drawing another straight line into the new "forward" direction and extend it backward, too. The two lines will intersect at what we call an angle and that angle is a measure for how much you turned. When we draw two parallel straight lines and a third line that crosses through both of them (that 3rd line is called a "transversal", by the way), 8 angles are created. The situation is depicted in figure...

\medskip
ToDo: draw a picture of two parallel lines and a 3rd line crossing both. we get 8 angles, name them (top to bottom, counterclockwise, starting top-right): $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ (top) and $\phi, \xi, \psi, \omega$ (bottom). 

\medskip
We call the pairs $(\alpha, \beta)$, $(\beta, \gamma)$, $(\gamma, \delta)$, $(\delta, \alpha)$ and the pairs $(\phi, \xi)$, $(\xi, \psi)$, $(\psi, \omega)$, $(\omega, \phi)$ \emph{adjacent angles} with respect to one another. Although I'm using tuple notation, the order doesn't matter - all relationships are symmetric. A pair of adjacent angles always "sums up" to what we call a \emph{straight angle} for which we reserve the special symbol $\pi$. By "sum up", we imagine to turn by some amount first and then turn by another amount and the "sum" is the total amount that we have turned. Thus, we have the relations:
\begin{equation}
  \pi = \alpha + \beta = \beta + \gamma = \gamma + \delta = \delta + \alpha 
      = \phi + \xi = \xi + \psi = \psi + \omega = \omega + \phi
\end{equation}
Furthermore, we call the pairs $(\alpha, \gamma)$, $(\beta, \delta)$ and $(\phi, \psi)$, $(\xi, \omega)$ \emph{opposite angles}. We see that they are equal to one another:
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \gamma, \; \beta = \delta, \; \phi = \psi, \; \xi = \omega
\end{equation}
The pairs $(\alpha, \phi)$, $(\beta, \xi)$, $(\gamma, \psi)$, $(\delta, \omega)$ are called \emph{corresponding angles} and are equal to one another:
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \phi, \; \beta = \xi, \; \gamma = \psi, \; \delta = \omega
\end{equation}
The pairs $(\delta, \phi)$, $(\gamma, \xi)$ are called \emph{consecutive interior angles} or just \emph{co-interior angles} or sometimes also \emph{neighbor angles}. The pairs  $(\alpha, \omega)$, $(\beta, \psi)$ are called \emph{co-exterior angles}. The pairs must sum up to a straight angle:
\begin{equation}
  \pi = \delta + \phi = \gamma + \xi = \alpha + \omega = \beta + \psi
\end{equation}
The pairs $(\gamma, \phi)$, $(\delta, \xi)$ are called \emph{alternate interior angles} and the pairs $(\beta, \omega)$, $(\alpha, \psi)$ are called \emph{alternate exterior angles}. They must be pairwise equal:
\begin{equation}
  \gamma = \phi, \; \delta = \xi, \; \beta = \omega, \; \alpha = \psi
\end{equation}
It's not important to memorize all these names. What is important is to be able to visually recognize such situations in a drawing. The straight angle which we have symbolized by $\pi$ is of special importance. We have not yet said anything about its numerical value or how to represent angles as numbers in general. The numerical value we associate with an angle is actually a matter of convention. In mathematics, we usually measure angles in radians in which case the numerical value of the angle is defined to be the length of the corresponding circular arc of a circle with radius one. The length of such an arc for a straight angle, i.e. the length of the perimeter of a half-circle (not counting the straight line), is around $3.14159$ and the actual exact value is a transcendental number with infinitely many decimal digits without any (known) pattern in them. In everyday life, that's a bit inconvenient so we usually prefer to use degrees to measure angles in which case a straight angle is \emph{defined} to be 180 degrees. Half of a straight angle is called a \emph{right angle} and it's the angle that occurs when two adjacent angles are equal to one another. In degrees, that would be 90 and in radians it's $\pi / 2$. The \emph{full angle} is defined to be twice the straight angle. It's 360 degrees or $2 \pi$ radians. Angles less than a right angle are called \emph{acute}, angles between right and straight are called \emph{obtuse} and angles between straight and full are called \emph{reflex}. You probably don't need to memorize these terms either. The number $\pi$ is also called the circle constant and it's one of the most important mathematical constants\footnote{In many mathematical formulas where $\pi$ occurs, it actually occurs as $2 \pi$, so it was suggested by some people that we should define a new circle constant $\tau = 2 \pi$ and use that instead of $\pi$ all throughout math. That would save writing a lot of multiplications by 2 at the expense of having to write a few more divisions by 2 for the couple of occasions where $\pi$ appears without the pre-factor of 2. If you want to learn more about this, search for "tau manifesto". I personally think, the proponents of $\tau$ have a point. Many people disagree and maybe even more find the whole discussion pointless.}, if not \emph{the} most important (only Euler's number $e$ could possibly compete).

\subsection{Trigonometry}
It's no coincidence that triangles featured prominently in the introduction above. They are the simplest and most basic shapes of all shapes. More complicated shapes, like polygons, can be split into a bunch of triangles. In turn, smooth shapes, like circles or ellipses, can be approximated by polygons to arbitrary accuracy. That's why triangles are the basic geometric building blocks of most if not all 2D or 3D rendering engines. So, it makes a lot of sense to look at triangles first and "trigonometry" does exactly that: it is literally the science of measuring triangles in greek: "trigonom" means triangle and "metry" is the science of measuring something.

\medskip
Let's consider a general triangle with side lengths $a,b,c$ where the angles opposite to these sides are called $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$. We then have the following 4 fundamental laws:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{c l}
  $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi$                       & Sum of interior angles \\
  $a / \sin \alpha = b / \sin \beta 
    = c / \sin \gamma 
    = 2R = \frac{abc}{2 A}$                             & Law of sines \\  
  $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos \gamma$                   & Law of cosines \\
  $\frac{a-b}{a+b} 
   = \frac{\tan \frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}}{\tan \frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}} 
   = \frac{\tan \frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}}{\cot \frac{\gamma}{2}}$
                                                        & Law of tangents \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

where the quantities $R, A$ appear. These and others can be computed via:

\medskip
\begin{tabular}{c l}
  $s = (a+b+c)/2$                 & Semiperimeter, half of the perimeter \\
  $A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$   & Area (via Heron's formula) \\
  $R = (abc)/ A$                  & Radius of circumscribed circle \\
  $r = A/s$                       & Radius of inscribed circle \\
\end{tabular}
\medskip

Half-angle formulas:
\begin{equation}
  \sin(\gamma / 2) = \sqrt{ (s-a)(s-b) / (a b)  },  \quad
  \cos(\gamma / 2) = \sqrt{ s(s-c) / (a b)  }
\end{equation}
