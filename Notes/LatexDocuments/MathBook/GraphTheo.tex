\chapter{Graph Theory}
Graph theory is the mathematical theory of, as you surely may have guessed from the name, networks. What? ...yeah - the name "graph theory" is yet another example of bad naming in math. The name "graph" in mathematics was actually already taken by functions graphs where it is more appropriate because such functions graphs are something we actually draw. In graph theory, the same name is used for an entirely different idea: a network of nodes that is connected by edges. That what graph theory is all about: how are a bunch of objects connected to each other. This can be used to mathematically model relationships between objects...TBC

%However, a graph ...TBC...
