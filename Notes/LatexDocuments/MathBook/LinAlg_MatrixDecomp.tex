Dear linear algebra students, This is what matrices (and matrix manipulation) really look like

Interpretation of matrices:

-in the context of solving linear systems of equations
 -each row gives a left-hand-side of one equation the system
 -each row defines a hyperplane, the solution of the system is the point where all
  hyperplanes intersect
 -each column represents a vector and we are looking for the coeffs to scale the 
  cols by to obtain agiven target vector on the RHS

-In the context of linear transformations:
 -the j-th column tells us where the j-th unit basis vector is mapped to
