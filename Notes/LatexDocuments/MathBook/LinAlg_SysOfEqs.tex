\section{Linear Systems of Equations}


\begin{comment}

Move into section about linear systems of equations:
-"Algebra" is generally about solving equations. Questions liek: 
 -How many solutions are there?
 -How can we find them? Is there a systematic algorithm to produce the solutions?
 -Is there some structure to the set of solutions.
  -In case of linear algebra: the structure of the solution set of a linear system of equations is:
   x_g = x_p + x_h where: x_g is the general solution, y_p is a particular solution and y_h is the
   homogeneous solution. The latter is a subspace of the space we are seeking solutions in that is 
   given by the solution of the corresponding
