\subsection{Induction}
Proof by induction is a proof technique that can be used to prove a statement $\varphi(n)$ that should hold for any natural number $n$ greater or equal to some given $n_0$ (which is often $0$ or $1$). The technique works by first showing directly that the statement holds true for $n_0$. It then goes on by showing that whenever the statement holds for some $n$, then it automatically follows that it must also hold for $n+1$. It then follows that $\varphi(n)$ holds for any $n \geq n_0$.

\paragraph{Example: Gauss's summation formula} A well known formula for the sum over all natural numbers up to some given $n$ is $\sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{n (n+1)}{2}$. We will use induction to prove that the formula works for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We need to first show it directly for $n=1$. We have $\sum_{k=1}^1 k = 1$ and we have $\frac{1 (1+1)}{2} = 1$, so the formula works for $n=1$. ...TBC...
