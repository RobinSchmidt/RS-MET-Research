\section{Partial Differential Equations}
One might think that a "partial" differential equation ought to be easier to deal with than a "full" differential equation, right? Wrong! The terminology might by a bit misleading. In this context, the term "partial" is not meant as opposite to "full" but rather refers to the fact that the equations contain partial derivatives of an unknown, to be found, multivariate function $f(x,y,\ldots)$. I think, a more appropriate term would be "multidimensional" or "multivariate" differential equations.
