\chapter{Multilinear Algebra}
Multilinear algebra is the study of operations that take multiple inputs and are linear in each of those inputs. For example, consider the sandwich product of two vectors and a matrix: $\mathbf{z = x^T A y}$. The matrix $\mathbf{A}$ can be thought of defining an operation that takes two vectors as inputs and produces a scalar as output. The so defined operation is indeed linear in both inputs in the sense that it makes no difference whether you add or scale at the input or output side.
