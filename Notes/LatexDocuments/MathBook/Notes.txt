Outline:

Part I: Continuous Mathematics
-Foundations: logic, set theory, numbers, functions (polynomials, rational, sin/exp/log, binomial
 theorem, partial fraction expansion)
-Calculus: limits, continuity, derivatives, integrals, (Taylor) series, convergence, differential 
 equations,
-Linear Algebra: vectors, matrices, various products (dot,cross,wedge,matrix), operators
-Geometry: Euclidean, Differential, Hyperbolic, Elliptic, synthetic, analytic
 coordinate systems, lines, planes, projections, shapes, areas, volumes, curves, 
 surfaces, maybe introduce sin/cos here - in functions, consider only poly/rational and powers, 
 i.e. algebraic functions, maybe the exponential, too
-Multilinear Algebra: tensors, exterior algebra (covectors, k-forms)
-Multivariable Calculus: vector, complex, exterior, geometric, tensor, partial differential 
 equations (present them in the various different formalisms)
-Functional Analysis: differential and integral operators, functionals, fourier- and laplace-trafo,
 variational calculus, distributions: dirac-delta and its derivatives
-Differential Geometry: manifolds

Part II: Discrete Mathematics
-Number Theory: divisibility, primes, modular arithmetic, Gaussian integers
-Discrete Calculus: differences, sums, difference equations, z-transforms, generating functions?
-Abstract Algebra: groups, rings, fields (including finite fields), representation
-Graph Theory
-Topology
-Combinatorics

Part III: Applications
-Optimization Theory: gradient descent, linear optimization, least squares
-Approximation Theory: Taylor, Fourier, Chebychev, orthogonal polynomials, curve fitting
-Physics: mechanics (Newton/Lagrange/Hamilton), phase space, electrodynamics (maxwell eqs in 
 different forms), quantum mechanics (uses operators and complex numbers), relativity (uses tensors
 and differential geometry), fluid dynamics
-Probability and Statistics, data science
-Numerics: interpolation, differentiation, integration, simulation of differential equations, 
 optimization, floating point numbers
-Signal Processing: filters (analog and digital -> ODEs and difference eqs), spectral (FFT, etc.),
 statistical (adaptive filters)
-Computer graphics and image processing - perhaps the most visual application of math, therefore 
 well suited to build mathematical intuition
-Dynamical Systems: attractors (fixed points, periodic, chaotic), bifurcation, fractals
-Geometry - computer graphics

Part IV: Code
-Python and/or Sage code for:
 -big integers and big floats, maybe complex arithmetic
 -polynomial and rational function computations
 -higher level integration stuff like finding potentials etc.
 -maybe code to generate figures...but maybe, i should do them with tikz


some special topics that i don't know where to fit:
-functional equations
-rational trigonometry (maybe in the discrete math part)
-all the different infinities
-infinities (countable/uncountable/Aleph) - maybe set theory
-computer science: relational databases
-fractional calculus
-non-Newtonian calculus
-delay-differential equations
-stochastic differential equations

some notes on the order of the chapters
-try to put the chapters in a logical order such that later chapters only refer to material that
 was already introduced in previous chapters. avoid forward references as much as possible. that 
 requirement may interfere with how topics belong logically together. the body of math knowledge
 is more like an entangled mesh rather than a nicely ordered tree (in the graph-theory sense), 
 especially for the higher level topics. the pedagogical challenge is to disentangle it.
-if in the operators section of linear algebra we also give things like d/dx as examples, we need
 to put calculus before that - but that may not be necessary. there are enough non-calc examples,
 like invert, multiply by fixed function, etc...but many of them are nonlinear..so yeah...maybe 
 calc should come first. otoh, operators may also be delayed to a later chapter (maybe functional
 analysis) and systems of linear ODEs need some LinAlg - we'll see..maybe put linalg before calc 
 and mention operators only briefly and discuss them fully in functional analysis
-maybe make a part "Elaborations" where certain topics that belong logically into earlier chapters
 are picked up again and explained in more detail. For example, ordinary differential equations 
 belong logically into the calculus chapter, i.e. should be introduced early, but the whole theory 
 of their solutions is way too extensive to present in such an early and basic chapter.
 or maybe it should be called "solution techniques" or "recipes"
-maybe there should be two variants of organizing the material: 1: in linear order without any
 forward references (for a first read) and 2: an organization by topic with liberal referencing 
 (for looking up stuff later)
-maybe make a part about weird, non-mainstream topics. for example, rational trigonometry, 
 fractional calculus, ...
 





ToDo:
-Introduce wedge product in the context of vector algebra, along with the dot-product and 
 scalar-vector product. The cross product may be treated as an awkward reformulation that is 
 specific to 3D. Make some historical notes about wedge vs cross product. ...but maybe the wedge
 product can be also delayed to a later chapter about exterior algebra
-Maybe first write the text and add the formulas later...and graphics even later. ideally, the text
 should be digestible without formulas and/or graphics - they should be an optional add-on. that 
 forces me to explain everything in words. In the Feynman lectures, it's also a pattern that many 
 formulas are also stated in words which makes them much easier to digest
-include python code in the text, realizing numerical and symbolic computations using numpy and 
 sympy, there should be a python library accompanying the book, maybe make plots with matplotlib
 but printing plotting code in the book may be too verbose...but may be useful to clarify things 
 dunno

 is about Taylor's formula, it introduces an interesting shift-operator notation:
 f(x+a) = exp(a * d/dx) f(x) where exp(a * d/dx) is an operator that shifts f by a. It generalizes 
 to nD as: f(x+a) = exp(a . nabla) f(x). Now x and a are vectors, . is the dot-product and nabla is 
 the formal vector of the partial derivative operators.
