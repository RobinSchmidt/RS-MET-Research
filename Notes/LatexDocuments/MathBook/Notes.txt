Outline:

Part I: Continuous Mathematics
-Foundations: logic, set theory, numbers, functions
-Calculus: limits, derivatives, integrals, differential equations, Taylor series
-Linear Algebra: vectors, matrices, operators
-Geometry: coordinate systems, lines, planes, projections, shapes, areas, volumes
-Multilinear Algebra: covectors, k-forms, tensors
-Multivariable Calculus: vector, complex, exterior, geometric, tensor, partial differential 
 equations (present them in the various different formalisms)
-Differential Geometry 
-Functional Analysis: differential and integral operators, functionals, fourier- and laplace-trafo,
 variational calculus


Part II: Discrete Mathematics
-Number Theory: divisibility, primes, modular arithmetic, Gaussian integers
-Discrete Calculus: differences, sums, difference equations, z-transforms
-Abstract Algebra: groups, rings, fields (including finite fields), representation
-Graph Theory
-Topology

Part III: Applications
-Optimization Theory: gradient descent, linear optimization, least squares
-Approximation Theory: Taylor, Fourier, Chebychev, orthogonal polynomials, curve fitting
-Physics: mechanics (Newton/Lagrange/Hamilton), phase space, electrodynamics (maxwell eqs in 
 different forms), quantum mechanics (uses operators and complex numbers), relativity (uses tensors
 and differential geometry)
-Probability and Statistics 
-Numerics: interpolation, differentiation, integration, simulation of differential equations
-Signal Processing: filters (analog and digital -> ODEs and difference eqs), spectral (FFT, etc.),
 statistical (adaptive filters)


also (don't know yet where this fits): 
-infinities (countable/uncountable/Aleph) - maybe set theory
-computer science: relational databases



ToDo:
-Introduce wedge product in the context of vector algebra, along with the dot-product and 
 scalar-vector product. The cross product may be treated as an awkward reformulation that is 
 specific to 3D. Make some historical notes about wedge vs cross product. ...but maybe the wedge
 product can be also delayed to a later chapter about exterior algebra
-Maybe first write the text and add the formulas later...and graphics even later. ideally, the text
 should be digestible without formulas and/or graphics - they should be an optional add-on. that 
 forces me to explain everything in words. In the Feynman lectures, it's also a pattern that many 
 formulas are also stated in words which makes them much easier to digest
