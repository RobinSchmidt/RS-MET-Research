Outline:

Part I: Continuous Mathematics
-Foundations: logic, set theory, numbers, functions
-Calculus: limits, continuity, derivatives, integrals, (Taylor) series, differential equations
-Linear Algebra: vectors, matrices, various products (dot,cross,wedge,matrix), operators
-Geometry: coordinate systems, lines, planes, projections, shapes, areas, volumes
-Multilinear Algebra: tensors, exterior algebra (covectors, k-forms)
-Multivariable Calculus: vector, complex, exterior, geometric, tensor, partial differential 
 equations (present them in the various different formalisms)
-Differential Geometry 
-Functional Analysis: differential and integral operators, functionals, fourier- and laplace-trafo,
 variational calculus

Part II: Discrete Mathematics
-Number Theory: divisibility, primes, modular arithmetic, Gaussian integers
-Discrete Calculus: differences, sums, difference equations, z-transforms, generating functions?
-Abstract Algebra: groups, rings, fields (including finite fields), representation
-Graph Theory
-Topology

Part III: Applications
-Optimization Theory: gradient descent, linear optimization, least squares
-Approximation Theory: Taylor, Fourier, Chebychev, orthogonal polynomials, curve fitting
-Physics: mechanics (Newton/Lagrange/Hamilton), phase space, electrodynamics (maxwell eqs in 
 different forms), quantum mechanics (uses operators and complex numbers), relativity (uses tensors
 and differential geometry)
-Probability and Statistics 
-Numerics: interpolation, differentiation, integration, simulation of differential equations
-Signal Processing: filters (analog and digital -> ODEs and difference eqs), spectral (FFT, etc.),
 statistical (adaptive filters)

some notes on the order of the chapters
-try to put the chapters in a logical order such that later chapters only refer to material that
 was already introduced in previous chapters. avoid forward references as much as possible. that 
 requirement may interfere with how topics belong logically together. the body of math knowledge
 is more like an entangled mesh rather than a nicely ordered tree (in the graph-theory sense), 
 especially for the higher level topics. the pedagogical challenge is to disentangle it.
-if in the operators section of linear algebra we also give things like d/dx as examples, we need
 to put calculus before that - but that may not be necessary. there are enough non-calc examples,
 like invert, multiply by fixed function, etc...but many of them are nonlinear..so yeah...maybe 
 calc should come first. otoh, operators may also be delayed to a later chapter (maybe functional
 analysis) - we'll see
-maybe make a part "Elaborations" where certain topics that belong logically into earlier chapters
 are picked up again and explained in more detail. For example, ordinary differential equations 
 belong logically into the calculus chapter, i.e. should be introduced early, but the whole theory 
 of their solutions is way too extensive to present in such an early and basic chapter.
 

also (don't know yet where this fits): 
-infinities (countable/uncountable/Aleph) - maybe set theory
-computer science: relational databases



ToDo:
-Introduce wedge product in the context of vector algebra, along with the dot-product and 
 scalar-vector product. The cross product may be treated as an awkward reformulation that is 
 specific to 3D. Make some historical notes about wedge vs cross product. ...but maybe the wedge
 product can be also delayed to a later chapter about exterior algebra
-Maybe first write the text and add the formulas later...and graphics even later. ideally, the text
 should be digestible without formulas and/or graphics - they should be an optional add-on. that 
 forces me to explain everything in words. In the Feynman lectures, it's also a pattern that many 
 formulas are also stated in words which makes them much easier to digest
