\chapter{Number Theory}
The great Carl Friedrich Gauss once said: "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics" \footnote{I fully agree with the first part but within math, I personally like calculus most. From a perspective of aesthetics and elegance, the continuous world of smooth functions appeals to me much more. Complex analysis, differential geometry, geometric calculus etc. - that's the really cool stuff for me. But who am I to controvert Gauss? And actually, there's also analytic number theory, so maybe that disagreement can be reconciled when the higher levels of number theory are reached.}. Number theory is mostly concerned with questions about discrete number systems such as the natural and integer numbers. When I say "discrete", I mean that the numbers in the studied systems are enumerable, i.e. have a cardinality equal to the of the naturals which means they are "only" countably infinite (and sometimes even finite). There is a branch of number theory, called "Transcendental Number Theory", that goes beyond the discrete worlds but by and large, number theory is considered to be a topic that firmly sits in the world of discrete mathematics. In a branch of number theory that is called "Analytic Number Theory", one makes use of continuous number systems such as the real and complex numbers. But there, these continuous numbers are only used as auxiliary tools and the questions that one ultimately seeks to answer are still about discrete numbers. A prime example (pun intended) of a topic in analytic number theory is the famous Riemann hypothesis which relates the distribution of the prime numbers (discrete!) to the zeros a certain analytic function (continuous!), i.e. a function that is defined over the complex plane. To this day, the question whether or not the hypothesis is true is considered to be one of the most important open questions in mathematics and many would probably even consider it \emph{the} most important. The other important branch of number theory is called "Algebraic Number Theory". Besides questions about prime numbers, number theory also studies the solubility of multivariate polynomial equations, called Diophantine equations, within the integers. Questions like: has the equation $a^n + b^n = c^n$ integer solutions for a given $n > 1 \in \mathbb{N}$, i.e. are there any triples $(a,b,c)$ of integer numbers that satisfy the equation. It turns out that for $n=2$, there are infinitely many such solutions, called the Pythagorean triples, and for $n > 2$ there are no integer solutions whatsoever. This is called "Fermat's Last Theorem", which - despite its name - isn't really a theorem that Fermat has proven. The status of a theorem was only attained in 1995 when Andrew Wiles published the first proof that was accepted by the mathematical community. Fermat claimed to have a proof but didn't publish it and it is widely believed today that the proof he had was probably erroneous. A distinctive feature of typical number theoretical problems is that the questions are often easy to ask but the proofs for the answers require highly advanced mathematical techniques. Number theory was for a long time considered to a topic in pure mathematics with no practical applications. The distinguished English number theorist Godfrey Harold Hardy (1877-1947) famously considered himself lucky to work in a field of math which, in his opinion, could never be used and abused for anything related to war. How wrong he was - today, number theory is the single most important branch of mathematics that is used in cryptography. The biggest employer of mathematicians on our beautiful planet is the National Security Agency (NSA) and most of them are number theorists.

%  Wiles' proof features advanced and modern tools from algebraic number theory prominently [VERIFY!] that were not yet known in Fermat's day.

%Before that proof, it should have been called "Fermat's Hypothesis" and after the publication "Wiles' Theorem". Well -

where does the Collatz Conjecture fit in? Maybe some sort of "Algorithmic Number Theory" or
"Recursion Theory" or "Recursive Series Theory"? What about the Ackermann function? Or busy beavers? I guess, we are venturing into the realms of theorectical computer science with these.
