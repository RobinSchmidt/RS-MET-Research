\section{Modular Arithmetic}

%===================================================================================================
\subsection{Operations}

\subsubsection{Addition and Multiplication}
% -also include division, explain how to construct the inverse elements for addition and 
%  multiplication
% -mention that division only works when modulus m is a prime - only then will have all elements
%  multiplicative inverses

\subsubsection{Exponentiation}
% -also include roots and logarithms
% -state conditions under which roots and logarithms exist


%===================================================================================================
\subsection{Theorems}


\subsubsection{The Chinese Remainder Theorem}
