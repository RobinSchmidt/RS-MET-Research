\section{Modular Arithmetic}


% Some authors use the abbreviation $\mathbb{Z}_p = \mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$ exclusively in the case where $p$ is prime. I have never seen a convincing justification for such a restriction (actually, not ever any justification at all), so I will liberally use the notation $\mathbb{Z}_n = \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ also for composite numbers $n$.

\section{Open Problems}
The field of number theory is full of open problems that are well known in popular math. This is because the problems are often easy to state but have turned out to be really hard to solve. Some problems can be understood with just middle school or even elementary school math background but even the best mathematicians in the world were not yet able to solve them. That's what makes them so charming for exposition in pop-math.

\paragraph{Goldbach's Conjecture}
This conjecture states that every even natural number greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers (not necessarily in a unique way). At the time of this writing, the conjecture has been experimentally verified for numbers up to $4 \cdot 10^{18}$ but a proof is still elusive. Although $10^{18}$ may sound like a lot, compared with infinity, it is about just as good (i.e. bad) as $10$ itself\footnote{OK - I may be slightly exaggerating. Having a conjecture hold for up to $10^{18}$ may give us a bit more confidence than having it to hold only up to $10$. But really, compared with infinity, every finite number is kinda like the same size - the ratio $\frac{finite}{infinity}$ is always exactly zero.}. And there have been historical examples for conjectures that did hold up experimentally for very big numbers but have nonetheless proven to be false ...TBC...give example

% every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.

% How about: Every natural number can be written as sum of 2 prime-powers? I have experimentally verified it in my head for numbers up to 20 (LOL!)...maybe write a little algorithm to test some more numbers.
