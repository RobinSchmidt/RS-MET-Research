\section{Modular Arithmetic}


% Some authors use the abbreviation $\mathbb{Z}_p = \mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$ exclusively in the case where $p$ is prime. I have never seen a convincing justification for such a restriction (actually, not ever any justification at all), so I will liberally use the notation $\mathbb{Z}_n = \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ also for composite numbers $n$.

\section{Open Problems}

\paragraph{Goldbach's Conjecture}
This conjecture states that every even natural number greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers (not necessarily in a unique way). It is one of the more famous number theoretical conjectures due to the simplicity of the statement. Finding a proof has turned out to be not at all simple, though. At the time of this writing, the conjecture has been experimentally verified for numbers up to $4 \cdot 10^{18}$ but a proof is still elusive. Although $10^{18}$ may sound like a lot, compared with infinity, it is about just as good (i.e. bad) as $10$ itself\footnote{OK - I may be slightly exaggerating. Having a conjecture hold for up to $10^{18}$ may give us a bit more confidence than having it to hold only up to $10$. But really, compared with infinity, every finite number is kinda like the same size - the ratio $\frac{finite}{infinity}$ is always exactly zero.}. And there have been historical examples for conjectures that did hold up experimentally for very big numbers but have nonetheless proven to be false ...TBC...give example

% every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.

% How about: Every natural number can be written as sum of 2 prime-powers? I have experimentally verified it in my head for numbers up to 20 (LOL!)...maybe write a little algorithm to test some more numbers.
