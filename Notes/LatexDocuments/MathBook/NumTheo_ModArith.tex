\section{Modular Arithmetic}


% Some authors use the abbreviation $\mathbb{Z}_p = \mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$ exclusively in the case where $p$ is prime. I have never seen a convincing justification for such a restriction (actually, not ever any justification at all), so I will liberally use the notation $\mathbb{Z}_n = \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ also for composite numbers $n$.

\subsection{Operations}

\subsubsection{Addition and Multiplication}
% -also include division, explain how to construct the inverse elements for addition and 
%  multiplication
% -mention that division only works when modulus m is a prime - only then will have all elements
%  multiplicative inverses

\subsubsection{Exponentiation}
% -also include roots and logarithms
% -state conditions under which roots and logarithms exist

\subsubsection{The Chinese Remainder Theorem}

\section{Open Problems}

\paragraph{Goldbach's Conjecture}
This conjecture states that every even natural number greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. It has, at the time of this writing, been experimentally verified for numbers up to $4 \cdot 10^{18}$ but a proof is still elusive ...TBC...

% How about: Every natural number can be written as sum of 2 prime-powers? I have experimentally verified it in my head for numbers up to 20 (LOL!)...maybe write a little algorithm to test some more numbers.
