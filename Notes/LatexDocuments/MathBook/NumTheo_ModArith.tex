\section{Modular Integers}


% Some authors use the abbreviation $\mathbb{Z}_p = \mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$ exclusively in the case where $p$ is prime. I have never seen a convincing justification for such a restriction (actually, not ever any justification at all), so I will liberally use the notation $\mathbb{Z}_n = \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ also for composite numbers $n$.

\subsubsection{Convergence on $\mathbb{Q}$}
We know from calculus that a sequence of (rational) numbers is said to converge to a limit $L$ if the distance between $L$ and the sequence elements becomes arbitrarily small. By that, we implicitly assume that by "distance" we mean the absolute value of the difference. It turns out that by defining a different distance measure, we can re-purpose this definition of convergence to mean something different. ...TBC...

\paragraph{Distance Metrics}
As distance between two numbers, we usually take the norm of their difference where "norm", so far, was just a fancy word for "absolute value". We know from one of the very first chapters (page \ref{Tab:Norm}) that there are a couple of properties that we expect from a sensible norm: positive definiteness, multiplicativity and triangle inequality. The usual absolute value on the rational numbers satisfies these requirements. It turns out, though, that there is an alternative possibility that also satisfies them. ...TBC...

%  is defined in a very different way.
% -Numbers that extend have many digits may have very small absolute value
% -The numbers exntend infinitely to the left

\section{Open Problems}
The field of number theory is full of open problems that are well known in popular math. This is because the problems are often easy to state but have turned out to be really hard to solve. Some problems can be understood with just middle school or even elementary school math background but even the best mathematicians in the world were not yet able to solve them. That's what makes them so charming for exposition in pop-math.

\paragraph{Goldbach's Conjecture}
This conjecture states that every even natural number greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers (not necessarily in a unique way). At the time of this writing, the conjecture has been experimentally verified for numbers up to $4 \cdot 10^{18}$ but a proof is still elusive. Although $10^{18}$ may sound like a lot, compared with infinity, it is about just as good (i.e. bad) as $10$ itself\footnote{OK - I may be slightly exaggerating. Having a conjecture hold for up to $10^{18}$ may give us a bit more confidence than having it to hold only up to $10$. But really, compared with infinity, every finite number is kinda like the same size - the ratio $\frac{finite}{infinity}$ is always exactly zero.}. And there have been historical examples for conjectures that did hold up experimentally for very big numbers but have nonetheless proven to be false ...TBC...give example

% every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.

% How about: Every natural number can be written as sum of 2 prime-powers? I have experimentally verified it in my head for numbers up to 20 (LOL!)...maybe write a little algorithm to test some more numbers.

\paragraph{Collatz's Conjecture}
Another unsolved number theoretic problem that is quite popular is the following: Consider the following simple algorithm: Start with any natural number $n > 1$. Now repeat: If the number is even, divide it by two, If the number is odd, triple it and add one. That means, in each iteration, you apply the simple function:
\begin{equation}
f(n) = \begin{cases}
n/2    \qquad & \text{if $n$ is even}  \\
3n + 1 \qquad & \text{if $n$ is odd}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
and take the result as input for the next iteration. The conjecture now says that for any starting value $n_0$, the iteration will eventually settle into the cycle $4-2-1-4-2-1-\ldots$. Experimentally, this was verified for numbers up to the order of $10^{20}$. The problem was brought up by Lothar Collatz in 1937 and his therefore named after him. Another name is the $3n + 1$ conjecture. There are generalizations......TBC...
