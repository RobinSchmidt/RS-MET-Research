General Relativity:

Famous quote by physicist John Archibald Wheeler about the essence of general relativity:

"Spacetime tells matter how to move, matter tells spacetime how to curve."

Analogy in Newton's world:
Forces tell masses how to move (accelerate): F = m a, a = F/m. Masses tell (gravitational) forces how to pull: F_g = G m_1 m_2 r / |r|^3. Maybe Newton's law should be rephrased in terms of momentum to make the analogy even closer: d p / d t = F

In relativity: The change of the energy-mmomentum tensor is some function of the metric tensor - in a sloppy symbolic way: T_{\mu \nu} = f( g_{\mu \nu} ) and likewise g_{\mu \nu} = f^{-1} (T_{\mu \nu}). But actually the function $f$ also depend on spatial and temporal derivatives of the (tensor valued) quantity $g$, not just on $g$ itself - although, if we assume $g = g(t,x,y,z)$ then that function actually contains all the info abouts its (partial) derivatives anyway. But usually, when we write down a differential equation, we make such dependencies on derivatives epxlicit by writing things like: $f(g, g_t, g_x, g_y, g_z, g_{tt}, g_{tx}, g_{ty}, \ldots)$

at 7:50, she says, "they are differential equations for the metric tensor". So, the focus seems to be on the time evolution of g, not T. The equations by themselves describe both on equal footing (I think)
