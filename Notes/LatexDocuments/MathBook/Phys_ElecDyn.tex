\section{Electrodynamics}
Electrodynamics describes the interaction between charged particles and electromagnetic fields. The field exerts forces on the charges and the charges themselves act as sources for the field. The field itself can also feature some interesting behaviors such as wave-like propagation. Electromagnetic waves are responsible for phenomena like light. ...TBC...

\subsection{Maxwell's Equations}
All the laws of classical electromagnetism are encapsulated is a system of 4 coupled partial differential equations known as \emph{Maxwell's equations} in honor to the British physicist James Clerk Maxwell ...TBC...
