\subsection{Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics}
This subfield of physics deals with the application of Newtonian (and sometimes quantum) mechanics to particle systems with a number of particles that is so huge, that it's impossible and also not meaningful to try to describe what individual particles do. Instead, one considers the properties of the whole ensemble of particles as a whole. Notions like density, pressure and temperature are developed as \emph{emergent} properties of the whole ensemble. The mathematical tools that are required for this are the ideas from probability theory and statistics. ...TBC...
