\section{Applications}
The mathematics developed so far has a lot of practical use cases. We need it to analyze data that we have collected from the real world. The goal is usually to discover underlying patterns in order to make predictions or just to understand what is going on. There are also situations in which we want to synthesize artificial random data according to certain specifications like a given probability distribution. Such data can be used for artistic purposes or for driving algorithms that incorporate some sort of randomness to achieve some higher goal like optimizing some process or computing some quantity. The results may be suboptimal or inaccurate but will with high probability be close to the desired optimum or value. Such randomized algorithms are generally known as "Monte Carlo methods" alluding to a place that is famous for its casinos.

% -Cryptographic security, period length, statistical independence

%cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators


\paragraph{Discrete Distributions}
% -explain how a prng that produces values in [0,1) can be used to produce discrete values,
%  say in 1,2,3,4,5,6
% -explain in general how a larger probability space can be used to simulate a smaller one. Maybe
%  such an "embedding" can be formalized as a sort of "probability homomorphism"? Is that already
%  a thing? If not, maybe such a definition could make sense?
% Consider two probability spaces (S1,E1,P1), (S2,E2,P2). We call a function f: E1 -> E2 a 
% "probability homomorphism" from (S1,E1,P1) to (S2,E2,P2) if it satisfies P2(f(A)) = P1(A)
% ...something along these lines. Here, A is a subset of S1 (i.e. element of E1) and f(A) a 
% subset of S2 (i.e. element of E2)

\paragraph{Arbitrary Distributions}
