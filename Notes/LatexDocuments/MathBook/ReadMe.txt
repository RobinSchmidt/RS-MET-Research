Rationale for writing this:

Explaining a math concept to someone else is one of the best ways to ensure that one has actually
understood it. Also, math ideas tend to fade quickly from memory when not used, so that someone 
else to whom I want to explain something with this book here will often be my later self. Things 
that I have once understood but forgotten will quickly get refreshed when reading my own 
explanations of them later. So, I write this partly for myself as a memory aid but I hope it to be 
useful to others as well. I do not claim that this is viable textbook in any sense. It's not! It 
should be seen more like personal lecture notes.
