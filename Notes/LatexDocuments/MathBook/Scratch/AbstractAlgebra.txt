Show that Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). That means, adjoining the single element
sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) to the rationals is the same as adjoining the two elements sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) to
it. Let:

  p = sqrt(2)
  q = sqrt(3)
  s = p + q    

Consider:

  r =  1 / s = 1 / (p+q) =  1 / (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) 
    =  (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3)) / ( (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) * (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3)) )
    =  (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3)) / ( 2 - 3 )
    =  sqrt(3) - sqrt(2)

This number r is in Q(s) by closure of fields under reciprocation. Now consider

  s + r = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))  +  (sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))  = 2 * sqrt(3)
  s - r = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))  -  (sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))  = 2 * sqrt(2)

These are also in Q(s) by closure of fields under addition and subtraction. By dividing them by 2, 
we get sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) which must also be in Q(s) by closure under division. Thus, we have 
produced both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) by doing only closed field operations with members of Q and our 
new element s.

Interpretation: By forming certain nonlinear(!) combinations of members from Q and the adjoined sum
of irrational numbers s = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3), we can produce sqrt(2) and sqrt(3)

Q: In the simplification of the expression for r, we multiplied numerator and denominator by the
   number (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3)) which is, a priori, not known to be member of Q(s). Why is this 
   allowed? I mean, in effect, we have multiplied the whole expression by 1. But still - can we 
   just assume the existence of a fraction x/x where x is not necessarily in our field?

Q: What does Q(x) look like for some symbolic variable x? When adjoining x to a ring, like in 
   forming the polynomial ring Z[x], we get all polynomials in x with coeffs from Z. A basis for 
   this ring would be x^n for n in N. I guess, Q(x) would be the field of all rational functions in 
   x with a basis x^n with n in Z? Would that work out? Or maybe the basis would be more 
   complicated? Does it even make sense to talk about a basis? Are we dealing with a vector space?
   Q(sqrt(2)) is a 2D vector space over Q - but Q(x) for a symbolic variable x? Is it an infinite
   dimensional vector space? But I think, some rational function like 1/p(x) with a polynomial p(x)
   that is irreducible over Q cannot be expressed  sum_{n=-inf}^{inf} a_n x^n  with a_n in Q. Maybe
   we need to invoke a partial fraction expansion of 1/p(x). Maybe we could use {1,x,x^2,x^2,...}
   to get all the polynomials and then add the reciprocals of all irreducible polynomials and their
   powers? ...seems complicated...figure out!


Q: How does a general element of Q(s) look like? Can it be expressed as a + b*s? Then it would be a
   2D vector space over Q. But an element of Q(p,q) looks like a + b*p + c*q + d*p*q and is 
   therefore a 4D vector space over Q. How can these two facts be reconciled? How can a 2D and 4D 
   vector space be (represent?) the same field?
   
   But maybe a general element of Q(s) cannot be expressed as a + b*s. When we adjoin a new element
   to a ring to form, for example, Z[x], we do *not* only get elements of the form a + b*x. We 
   already get all polynomials in x with coeffs from Z. So, I guess, that's where my thinking goes 
   wrong. Maybe try forming a product (a + b*s) and (c + d*s) and see what comes out. It probably 
   won't be of the same form. Maybe also try a quotient.

OK - let's try it:

    (a + b*s) * (c + d*s)
  = ac + ads + bsc + bdss = ac + (ad+bc)s + bdss

OK - we get  ac + (ad+bc)s  terms which are of the same form as the inputs. But the s^2 is, in 
general, something else. s^2 = (p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = sqrt(2)^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)^2
= 2 + 2*sqrt(6) + 3.

ToDo:

- Show different bases for Q(p,q) and how the basis vectors of one can be expressed in terms of the 
  others. One basis is (1,p,q,pq) = (1,sqrt(2),sqrt(3),sqrt(6)). Obtain one basis by first adjoining
  sqrt(2) then sqrt(3). Obtain another by doing the adjoinments the other way around - maybe it will
  be same? that is: Do Q(p)(q), then do Q(q)(p). Maybe the resulting will be 
  (1,sqrt(2),sqrt(3),sqrt(6)) in both cases? Then create a basis for Q(s). To create a basis, 
  consider the product of two elements of the form (a + bq). Maybe try it numerically with class
  rsQuadraticField by nesting it.





Q: What about general p = sqrt(m), q = sqrt(n)? Or just general p,q?


Let's make it more general: show that  Q(sqrt(m) + sqrt(n)) = Q(sqrt(m), sqrt(n)). Define:

  p = sqrt(m)
  q = sqrt(n)
  s = p + q  

We need to show that we can produce the numbers p and q via (nonlinear) combinations of members from
Q(s). Consider:

  r = 1 / s = 1 / (p + q)

...tbc...

It is, by closure of fields under reciprocation, a member of Q(s).

-Splitting fields are not unique - but isomorphic...soo - unique up to isomorphism, I guess.
-We can always factor a difference of two cubes as follows:
 (a^3 - b^3) = (a-b) * (a^2 + a*b + b^2)

-Algebraic number theory is about how the rules of numbers change (what is prime, etc.) when we look
 into number rings beyond the integers - it's important to look at rings and not at fields because
 primes are not a thing in fields.
-3:50: interpret 2*3 = 6 in a different way: all multiples of 2 times all multiples of 3 give all
 multiples of 6. This is how factoring a number into prime numbers will generalize to factoring an 
 ideal into prime ideals.

-If an equation is solvable by radicals then there must exist a tower of radical extensions to Q
 whose highest layer contains all the roots. We must be able to adjoin the roots one by one.

Prelude to Galois Theory: Exploring Symmetric Polynomials
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3imeTgGBaLc  by Martin Trifonov
-Talks about multivariate polynomials. Specfically, the funcdamental theorem of symmetric 
 polynomials. This is supposed to be some sort of prelimary to Galois theory.
 I think, the idea is that when the different variables are
 the roots of some polynomial, then we can permute them and the polynomial equation still holds 
 true?
 9:28 elementary symmetric polynomials encode the pattern by which the roots of an arbitrary 
      polynomial are related ot its coefficients
11:20 Any power sum (e.g. x^k + y^k + z^k) can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric 
      polynomials. (Newton's theorem) ...not a linear combination, though - it's a polynomial 
      expression
18:50 All symmetric polynomials can be expressed in terms of power sums - togethr with the former 
      theorem, this means that all symmetric polanomials can be created using only polynomial  
      expressions of the elementary symmetric polynomials
29:17 The space of expressions in the roots is the arena in which Galois theory plays out. Galois 
      theory considers the symmetry of expressions in the roots of polynomials
