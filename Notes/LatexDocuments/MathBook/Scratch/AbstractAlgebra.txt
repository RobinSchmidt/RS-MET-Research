Show that Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). That means, adjoining the single element
sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) to the rationals is the same as adjoining the two elements sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) to
it. Let:

  p = sqrt(2)
  q = sqrt(3)
  s = p + q    

Consider:

  r =  1 / s = 1 / (p+q) =  1 / (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) 
    =  (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3)) / ( (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) * (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3)) )
    =  (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3)) / ( 2 - 3 )
    =  sqrt(3) - sqrt(2)

This number r is in Q(s) by closure of fields under reciprocation. Now consider

  s + r = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))  +  (sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))  = 2 * sqrt(3)
  s - r = (sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))  -  (sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))  = 2 * sqrt(2)

These are also in Q(s) by closure of fields under addition and subtraction. By dividing them by 2, 
we get sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) which must also be in Q(s) by closure under division. Thus, we have 
produced both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) by doing only closed field operations with members of Q and our 
new element s.

Interpretation: By forming certain nonlinear(!) combinations of members from Q and the adjoined sum
of irrational numbers s = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3), we can produce sqrt(2) and sqrt(3)

Q: In the simplification of the expression for r, we multiplied numerator and denominator by the
   number (sqrt(2) - sqrt(3)) which is, a priori, not known to be member of Q(s). Why is this 
   allowed? I mean, in effect, we have multiplied the whole expression by 1. But still - can we 
   just assume the existence of a fraction x/x where x is not necessarily in our field?

Q: How does a general element of Q(s) look like? Can it be expressed as a + b*s? Then it would be a
   2D vector space over Q. But an element of Q(p,q) looks like a + b*p + c*q + d*p*q and is 
   therefore a 4D vector space over Q. How can these two facts be reconciled? How can a 2D and 4D 
   vector space be (represent?) the same field?
   
   But maybe a general element of Q(s) cannot be expressed as a + b*s. When we adjoin a new element
   to a ring to form, for example, Z[x], we do *not* only get elements of the form a + b*x. We 
   already get all polynomials in x with coeffs from Z. So, I guess, that's where my thinking goes 
   wrong. Maybe try forming a product (a + b*s) and (c + d*s) and see what comes out. It probably 
   won't be of the same form. Maybe also try a quotient.

OK - let's try it:

    (a + b*s) * (c + d*s)
  = ac + ads + bsc + bdss = ac + (ad+bc)s + bdss

OK - we get  ac + (ad+bc)s  terms which are of the same form as the inputs. But the s^2 is, in 
general, something else. s^2 = (p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = sqrt(2)^2 + 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)^2
= 2 + 2*sqrt(6) + 3.

ToDo:

- Show different bases for Q(p,q) and how the basis vectors of one can be expressed in terms of the 
  others. One basis is (1,p,q,pq) = (1,sqrt(2),sqrt(3),sqrt(6)). Obtain one basis by first adjoining
  sqrt(2) then sqrt(3). Obtain another by doing the adjoinments the other way around - maybe it will
  be same? that is: Do Q(p)(q), then do Q(q)(p). Maybe the resulting will be 
  (1,sqrt(2),sqrt(3),sqrt(6)) in both cases? Then create a basis for Q(s). To create a basis, 
  consider the product of two elements of the form (a + bq). Maybe try it numerically with class
  rsQuadraticField by nesting it.





Q: What about general p = sqrt(m), q = sqrt(n)? Or just general p,q?


Let's make it more general: show that  Q(sqrt(m) + sqrt(n)) = Q(sqrt(m), sqrt(n)). Define:

  p = sqrt(m)
  q = sqrt(n)
  s = p + q  

We need to show that we can produce the numbers p and q via (nonlinear) combinations of members from
Q(s). Consider:

  r = 1 / s = 1 / (p + q)

...tbc...

It is, by closure of fields under reciprocation, a member of Q(s).
