A topological space S is a tuple(?) S = (X,T) where X is some set and T is a set of subsets, called
"a" topology, if it satisfies:

  1) T contains the empty set and the whole set X
  2) Arbitrary unions of elements of T are also in T.
  3) Finite intersections of elements of T are also in T.
  
We say:

  1) If A is in T, then A is an open set (why?).
  2) If x is in A and A is in T, then A is an (open?) neighborhood of x.
