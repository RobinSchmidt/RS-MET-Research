Group Theory:

Composing C_12 from its constituent simple groups:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_series#For_groups

For C_12, there are 3 different composition series:

C_1 * C_2 = C_2
C_2 * C_3 = C_6
C_6 * C_2 = C_12

C_1 * C_2 = C_2
C_2 * C_2 = C_4
C_4 * C_3 = C_12

C_1 * C_3 = C_3
C_3 * C_2 = C_6
C_6 * C_2 = C_12

...i think, in such a composition seris, the 2nd factor must always be simple and that's why we see
no C_3 * C_4. But what if we form C_3 * C_4? Will that be the saem as C_4 * C_3? ...yeah - in case 
of the direct product, it certainly will because the set product is commutative (up to isomorphy, 
i.e. a set product Z_3 x Z_4 is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_3 - it has just the elements swapped)

"Any two composition series of a given group are equivalent. That is, they have the same composition 
length and the same composition factors, up to permutation and isomorphism"


Maybe demonstrate the construction of semidirect products with a pair of groups of which at least 
one non-abelian. But there aren't many non-abelian small groups. The smallest is of order 6:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_group#Number_of_groups_of_a_given_order

Maybe use that and Z_2 as other factor. that gives a group of order 12 which is still managable

Ultimate Recipe to Construct Every Finite Group | Group Extensions and Computational Group Theory
Is about building groups as products from other groups

0:50
-Decomposition is actually simpler than forming a product
-this is the group extension problem

8:35:
-an isomorphism of a group to itself is called automorphism
-A group can be isomorphic to itself in more ways than just the identity automorphism
-Aut(C_10) = {id, s_3, s_7, s_9}  where  s_k: n -> k*n
 -Set of automorphisms on C_10 (cyclic group of order 10)
 -This set is actually itself a group (this is meta!)
 -Aut(C_10) <= Sym(C_10) ~= S_10
 -Aut(C_10) = <s_3> ~= C_4    <s_3> means it's generated by s_3

11:07:
-D_8 = <r,s>  where r: 90Â° rotation, s: reflection (any will do)
-D_8 decomposes into <s> = C_2 and <r> = C_4
-this kind of decomposition is called "split" (?)
-C_4 is not a simple group and also doesn't have a split decomposition
-We need a quotient group to decompose C_4
-C_2 ~= <r^2> <= C_4  C_2  is isomorphic to  <r^2>  which is a (normal) subgroup of  C_4
 Cosets: <r^2> = {1, r^2} = [1], r <r^2> = {r, r^3} = [r]
 [r] is a coset where r is its representative
-C_4 / <r^2> = <[r]> ?= {[1], [r]}  is the quotient group of C_4 by 
 <[r]> ~= C_2
-But: our first split by C_2 was not valid because C_2 is not a *normal* subgroup. But C_4 is. So 
 we need to split out C_4 first
 
...

-We can make all *abelian* groups just using the direct product and the cyclic groups
 ...but: at 22:22: C_2 x C_2  is not isomorphic to C_4! this can be seen from the orders of the
 elements
 -we need to keep the cyclic groups of non-prime order as atomic elements, too. We can't make them
 as direct products from smaller cyclic groups
-for a prime number p and a group of order p^n for integer n, the number of groups of order p^n is
 given by the partition function of n
 
20:25:
semidirect product: 
-example: product of translations and rotations
-consider (a,A) * (b,B)  where a,b are the translations and A,B the rotations
-the composed action is (a,A) * (b,B) = (a + Ab, AB)
-D_2n ~= semidirect(C_n, C_2)

Ring Theory:

Number Systems Invented to Solve the Hardest Problem - History of Rings | Ring Theory E0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-9_rZfVQVE&list=PL6VQBwZazp7YSRz9jluchQJSDRv_yQKeZ

Pythagorean triples:
-integer triples (a,b,c) that satisfy a^2 + b^2 = c^2
-let n > m >= 1, gcd(n,m) = 1, n+m odd (i.e. not n and m both even or both odd)
-then (a,b,c) = k * (n^2 - m^2, 2*n*m, n^2 + m^2) gives all the Pythagorean triples up to swapping 
 a and b.
-for k = 1, we get the simple triples that are not just a multiple of another such triple
-proof of this is highly nontrivial
-real solutions are easy to find: just pick a,b and use c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) but finding integer 
 solutions was hard.

Rng: 
-not number systems but generalizations of multiples of a number
-important mostly as substructure of a ring

Z[i]
-smallest ring over z that contains i
-units ar e+-1, +-i
-every number except zero has 4 numbers that are associated with one another, example:
 7, -7, 7i, -7i  or  2 + 3i, 2 - 3i, -2 + 3i, -2 - 3i
-2 is not a prime anymore, it factors as: 2 = (1+i)(1-i)
-neither is 5: 5 = (1+2i)(1-2i)
-a^2 + b^2 = (a+bi)(a-bi). Factoring this sum of squares into linear factors was impossible over Z
-Z[i] can be used to find the pythagorean triples

Z[2] = Z

Z[1/2]:
-we need 1/2, 7/2, 1/4, -57/16, i.e. all numbers of the form a / 2^n where a is an integer and n is
 a positive integer. We could allow n to be positive too but that would only generate elements that 
 are already there.
-powers of 2 are units of this ring
-called dyadic rationals or binary rationals
 -used to store floating point numbers in a computer
 
Z[1/2, 1/3, 1/5, 1/7, 1/11, ...] = Q
R[i] = C

Z[sqrt(-3)] = Z[sqrt(3)i]
-invented by Euler as first of these systems to solve Fermat's last theorem for the case n = 3, i.e.
 to show that a^3 + b^3 = c^3 has no nontrivial integer solutions (but only solutions in this ring?)
-He needed to factor an expression of the form u^2 + 3*v^2. In Z[sqrt(-3)] , we have
 u^2 + 3*v^2 = (u + sqrt(-3) v) (u - sqrt(-3) v) 
-His proof was wrong though, because the factorization of numbers down to primes need to be unique 
 and this is not the case in this ring.
-For example, 4 factors in 2 ways: 4 = 2*2 = (1 - sqrt(-3)) (1 + sqrt(-3))
 [actually there are also 4 = (-2)*(-2) and perhaps also (-1 - sqrt(-3)) (-1 + sqrt(-3))?]
-This ring is *not* a unique factorization domain

4th roots of 1:
-are given by 1, i, -1, -i
-are all on the unit circle and split it into 4ths
-smallest ring over Z that contains all these is Z[i]

3rd roots of 1:
-given by 1, w, w^2 where w = -1/2 + i * sqrt(3)/2 = e^(2 pi i / 3)
-split the circle into thirds
-smallest ring over Z containing these is Z[w]
-contains lattice points of a lattice made from equilateral triangles
-this ring is called Eisenstein integers
-has 6 units: 1, -1, w, w^2, -w, -w^2
-contains sqrt(-3), too and therefore everything in Z[sqrt(-3)]
-here, u^2 + 3*v^2 = (u + sqrt(-3) v) (u - sqrt(-3) v)  factors uniquely. 
-4 still factors in the same 2 ways as before, BUT: over this ring, the two ways are not really 
 considered different anymore because the two ways are associated with each other, i.e. rotated 
 versions of the same number
 -The factorization is now indeed unique up to pulling out units (these units are NOT present in
  in Z[sqrt(-3)].
 -This is analog to 4 factoring into (-2)*(-2) as well
-This patches Euler's false proof
-a^3 + b^3 = (a + b) (a^2 - ab + b^2) = (a + b) (a + bw) (a + bw^2)
 -> it factors into linear factors which is crucial step in Gauss' proof of a^3 + b^3 = c^3 has no 
 integer solutions
 
a^4 + b^4 = c^4:
-Can be proven in a similar way using the Gaussian integers
-Can also be proven in an elementary way by writing it as:
 (a^2)^2 + (b^2)^2 = (c^2)^2
-The problem is now reframed as: can there be a Pythagoreran triple in which a,b,c are all square 
 numbers.
-4 is the only composite number for which this needs to be checked seperately
-for all other composite numbers, because take for example n = 30, we can write the eq as:
 (a^10)^3 + (b^10)^3 = (c^10)^3
 which can only be true, if the eq can also be solve for n=3, i.e. existence of solutions for n=3
 is a necesarry (but not suffient) condition for the eq to be true.
-n=2 is the only number for which the necesarry condition is actually true.
-we have to check only for the case n=4 seperately and then for primes. All other composite numbers
 will have a prime factorization with at least 4 = 2^2 or some prime p > 2 in it, so we can always 
 pull out such an outer prime exponent to arrive a a necesarry condition
 
 
x^5 = 1
-Let's adjoin zeta_5 = primitive 5th root of unity to Z, i.e. construct Z[zeta_5], I'll abbreviate 
 zeta_5 as z
-The ring is called the cyclotomic integers
-cyclotomic means circle splitting
-Gaussian and Eisenstein integers are specific examples for 4 and 3.
-a^5 + b^5 = (a + b z^0) (a + b z^1) (a + b z^2) (a + b z^3) (a + b z^4)
-from here, the proof proceeds similar to the n = 3 case
-it works also for 7,11,13,17,19
-it doesn't work for 23 because Z[zeta_23] is not a unique factorization domain (UFD)
 
Kummer's Ideal Numbers
-Z[zeta_23] is no UFD but it is integrally closed
-Consider Z[sqrt(-5)]. This is also a non-UFD but integrally closed (and simpler than Z[zeta_23])
-Here 6 = 2*3 = (1 + sqrt(-5)) (1 - sqrt(-5))
-Are the factors really "primes" if the factorization is not unique?
 -Kummer redefines primes to be only called primes in the case of a unique factorization
 -The factors are now called irreducible instead. Irreducible numbers can't be factored any further
  and may or may not be prime
  
 [this part I don't understand]
 -Kummer invents new "imaginary" numbers which he calls "ideal prime numbers"
  -over integrally closed non-UFDs, every number would factor into these ideal primes
  -these ideal primes are similar to p-adic numbers
  
Dedekind's Ideals
-Over Z, the ideal generated by 2, written as (2) is the set of the multiples of 2
-The multiples of -2, denoted as (-2) is the same set.
-The ideal generated by 2 and 10, is the set of linear combinations of 2 and 10.
 -because 2 divides 10, this is again the same set (2)
-(2,3) = {2n + 3m : n,m in Z} = (1) = Z because 3 - 2 = 1, i.e. 1 is contained in (2,3) and (1) 
 generates Z
-A product of ideals such as (2)(3) is defined as smallest rng inside the ring that contains all 
 the products of elements from (2) and (3). It's given by (6)
-This ideal stuff redefines factorization of numbers into primes into factorizations of ideals into
 prime ideals
-In the integers, these factorizations are excatly the same (because they are a UFD?)
-in a non-UFD...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MflpyJwhMhQ  What is algebraic geometry?

0:43: consider the unit circle x^2 + y^2 = 1  ->  p(x) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0
-We study functions *on* the unit circle, i.e. functions f(x,y) that take a point (x,y) on the unit
 circle, for example f(x,y) = x + 2*y
-Consider g(x,y) = f(x,y) + p(x,y) = x + 2*y  +  x^2 + y^2 - 1
-The 2nd part of g, namely p(x,y), always evaluates to zero on the unit circle
 -> g and f are the same as function defined only on the unit circle
-More generally, any function of the form g(x,y) = f(x,y) + h(x,y) * p(x,y) will be equal to f(x,y)
 on the unit circle, because h(x,y) * p(x,y) will still evaluate to zero whatever h is.
-Take R to be the set of all polynomials defined on the unit circle. Member of R are considered 
 to be the euqal to each other, if they evaluate to the same value on the unit circle. 
-R is a ring and is called the coordinate ring of the circle and we view it as an algebraic 
 manifestation of the circle. It encodes geometric properties of the circle in its algebraic 
 properties. This is the quotient ring: R = \mathbb{R}[x,y] / (x^2 + y^2 - 1), i.e. \mathbb{R}[x,y]
 modulo the ideal generated by x^2 + y^2 - 1
-Compare (y-x)*(y+x) = 0  with  x + y^2 = 0.
 -The first set is tow diagonal lines crossing at the origin
 -The second is a left open parabola
-The 1st a union of 2 curve (reducible), the 2nd is just 1 curve (irreducible)
-Let R be the coordinate ring (i.e. ring of functions on) of (x-y)*(y+x) = 0 and S be the one 
 of x + y^2 = 0.
-We have (y-x)(y+x) = 0 (identically) even though (y-x) and (y+x) taken alone are not identically
 zero (there are pairs xy where they evaluate to nonzero). A product of two nonzero factors is zero!
-This does not happen in S. On the parabola, if we consider polynomials on it, if a product
 f(x,y)*g(x,y) is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero
-The presence of such zero divisors detects reducibility
5:17: y^2 = x^2 * (x + 1) intersects itself, has a node at the origin

Weitz takes the example polynomial:  x^5 - x - a = 0  where a is a parameter that can be 
continuously tweaked in the complex plane. For a = 0, we have  x^5 - x = 0  and the roots are 0 and 
1,i,-1,-i. I think in general x^n - x = 0 has roots at 0 and the (n-1)-th roots of unity. I think 
the idea is that any algorithm that should produce the n roots of a degree n polynomial needs to 
consist of n formulas f_1, ..., f_n each of which should be continuous(!!) function of the n+1 
coeffs a0,...,a_n. The formulas for n=3, and n=4 seem to be built in a way that they need a square 
root in the 1st step, a 3rd root in the 2nd step and a 4th root in the 3rd step. Each of these n-th
roots produces n solutions which must enter *all* into the next step. At the end we have n! 
solutions of which only n are distinct. For n = 3, we get 6 = 3! paths through the tree down to the 
solutions. For n = 4, we get 24 = 4! paths through the tree. But of these 24 solutions, only 4 are
distinct.

I guess each solution r_1 = ..., r_n = corresponds to one path through the tree that generates the 
solutions. I guess for n <= 4, two different paths that permute a solution in some way, must do this 
in a way that leads to continuous functions f_1,...f_n whereas in the n > 4 case, that is not the 
case anymore?

2eOw_TKsFXg  seems to use the same approach as Weitz

Consider numbers with digits continuing infinitely to the left. Our normal numbers would just be
left-padded with infinitely many zeros just the same way as we can imagine appending infinitely many
zeros to the right to a decimal expansion. According to our usual rule of addition with pencil and
paper using carry digits, we have:

        ...99999999
     +  ...00000001
  ------------------
        ...00000000
		
But if ...9999 + ...0001 = 0, we must conclude that ...9999 = -1
