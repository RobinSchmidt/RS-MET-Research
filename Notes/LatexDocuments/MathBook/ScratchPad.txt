Group Theory:

Composing C_12 from its constituent simple groups:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_series#For_groups

For C_12, there are 3 different composition series:

C_1 * C_2 = C_2
C_2 * C_3 = C_6
C_6 * C_2 = C_12

C_1 * C_2 = C_2
C_2 * C_2 = C_4
C_4 * C_3 = C_12

C_1 * C_3 = C_3
C_3 * C_2 = C_6
C_6 * C_2 = C_12

...i think, in such a composition seris, the 2nd factor must always be simple and that's why we see
no C_3 * C_4. But what if we form C_3 * C_4? Will that be the saem as C_4 * C_3? ...yeah - in case 
of the direct product, it certainly will because the set product is commutative (up to isomorphy, 
i.e. a set product Z_3 x Z_4 is isomorphic to Z_4 x Z_3 - it has just the elements swapped)

"Any two composition series of a given group are equivalent. That is, they have the same composition 
length and the same composition factors, up to permutation and isomorphism"


Maybe demonstrate the construction of semidirect products with a pair of groups of which at least 
one non-abelian. But there aren't many non-abelian small groups. The smallest is of order 6:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_group#Number_of_groups_of_a_given_order

Maybe use that and Z_2 as other factor. that gives a group of order 12 which is still managable

Pythagorean triples:
-integer triples (a,b,c) that satisfy a^2 + b^2 = c^2
-let n > m >= 1, gcd(n,m) = 1, n+m odd (i.e. not n and m both even or both odd)
-then (a,b,c) = k * (n^2 - m^2, 2*n*m, n^2 + m^2) gives all the Pythagorean triples up to swapping 
 a and b.
-for k = 1, we get the simple triples that are not just a multiple of another such triple
-proof of this is highly nontrivial
-real solutions are easy to find: just pick a,b and use c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) but finding integer 
 solutions was hard.

Rng: 
-not number systems but generalizations of multiples of a number
-important mostly as substructure of a ring

Z[i]
-smallest ring over z that contains i
-units ar e+-1, +-i
-every number except zero has 4 numbers that are associated with one another, example:
 7, -7, 7i, -7i  or  2 + 3i, 2 - 3i, -2 + 3i, -2 - 3i
-2 is not a prime anymore, it factors as: 2 = (1+i)(1-i)
-neither is 5: 5 = (1+2i)(1-2i)
-a^2 + b^2 = (a+bi)(a-bi). Factoring this sum of squares into linear factors was impossible over Z
-Z[i] can be used to find the pythagorean triples

Z[2] = Z

Z[1/2]:
-we need 1/2, 7/2, 1/4, -57/16, i.e. all numbers of the form a / 2^n where a is an integer and n is
 a positive integer. We could allow n to be positive too but that would only generate elements that 
 are already there.
-powers of 2 are units of this ring
-called dyadic rationals or binary rationals
 -used to store floating point numbers in a computer
 
Z[1/2, 1/3, 1/5, 1/7, 1/11, ...] = Q
R[i] = C

Z[sqrt(-3)] = Z[sqrt(3)i]
-invented by Euler as first of these systems to solve Fermat's last theorem for the case n = 3, i.e.
 to show that a^3 + b^3 = c^3 has no nontrivial integer solutions (but only solutions in this ring?)
-He needed to factor an expression of the form u^2 + 3*v^2. In Z[sqrt(-3)] , we have
 u^2 + 3*v^2 = (u + sqrt(-3) v) (u - sqrt(-3) v) 
-His proof was wrong though, because the factorization of numbers down to primes need to be unique 
 and this is not the case in this ring.
-For example, 4 factors in 2 ways: 4 = 2*2 = (1 - sqrt(-3)) (1 + sqrt(-3))
 [actually there are also 4 = (-2)*(-2) and perhaps also (-1 - sqrt(-3)) (-1 + sqrt(-3))?]
-This ring is *not* a unique factorization domain

4th roots of 1:
-are given by 1, i, -1, -i
-are all on the unit circle and split it into 4ths
-smallest ring over Z that contains all these is Z[i]

3rd roots of 1:
-given by 1, w, w^2 where w = -1/2 + i * sqrt(3)/2 = e^(2 pi i / 3)
-split the circle into thirds
-smallest ring over Z containing these is Z[w]
-contains lattice points of a lattice made from equilateral triangles
-this ring is called Eisenstein integers
-has 6 units: 1, -1, w, w^2, -w, -w^2
-contains sqrt(-3), too and therefore everything in Z[sqrt(-3)]
-here, u^2 + 3*v^2 = (u + sqrt(-3) v) (u - sqrt(-3) v)  factors uniquely. 
-4 still factors in the same 2 ways as before, BUT: over this ring, the two ways are not really 
 considered different anymore because the two ways are associated with each other, i.e. rotated 
 versions of the same number
 -The factorization is now indeed unique up to pulling out units (these units are NOT present in
  in Z[sqrt(-3)].
 -This is analog to 4 factoring into (-2)*(-2) as well
-This patches Euler's false proof
-a^3 + b^3 = (a + b) (a^2 - ab + b^2) = (a + b) (a + bw) (a + bw^2)
 -> it factors into linear factors which is crucial step in Gauss' proof of a^3 + b^3 = c^3 has no 
 integer solutions
 
a^4 + b^4 = c^4:
-Can be proven in a similar way using the Gaussian integers
-Can also be proven in an elementary way by writing it as:
 (a^2)^2 + (b^2)^2 = (c^2)^2
-The problem is now reframed as: can there be a Pythagoreran triple in which a,b,c are all square 
 numbers.
-4 is the only composite number for which this needs to be checked seperately
-for all other composite numbers, because take for example n = 30, we can write the eq as:
 (a^10)^3 + (b^10)^3 = (c^10)^3
 which can only be true, if the eq can also be solve for n=3, i.e. existence of solutions for n=3
 is a necesarry (but not suffient) condition for the eq to be true.
-n=2 is the only number for which the necesarry condition is actually true.
-we have to check only for the case n=4 seperately and then for primes. All other composite numbers
 will have a prime factorization with at least 4 = 2^2 or some prime p > 2 in it, so we can always 
 pull out such an outer prime exponent to arrive a a necesarry condition
 
 
x^5 = 1
-Let's adjoin zeta_5 = primitive 5th root of unity to Z, i.e. construct Z[zeta_5], I'll abbreviate 
 zeta_5 as z
-The ring is called the cyclotomic integers
-cyclotomic means circle splitting
-Gaussian and Eisenstein integers are specific examples for 4 and 3.
-a^5 + b^5 = (a + b z^0) (a + b z^1) (a + b z^2) (a + b z^3) (a + b z^4)
-from here, the proof proceeds similar to the n = 3 case
-it works also for 7,11,13,17,19
-it doesn't work for 23 because Z[zeta_23] is not a unique factorization domain (UFD)
 
Kummer's Ideal Numbers
-Z[zeta_23] is no UFD but it is integrally closed
-Consider Z[sqrt(-5)]. This is also a non-UFD but integrally closed (and simpler than Z[zeta_23])
-Here 6 = 2*3 = (1 + sqrt(-5)) (1 - sqrt(-5))
-Are the factors really "primes" if the factorization is not unique?
 -Kummer redefines primes to be only called primes in the case of a unique factorization
 -The factors are now called irreducible instead. Irreducible numbers can't be factored any further
  and may or may not be prime
  
 [this part I don't understand]
 -Kummer invents new "imaginary" numbers which he calls "ideal prime numbers"
  -over integrally closed non-UFDs, every number would factor into these ideal primes
  -these ideal primes are similar to p-adic numbers
  
Dedekind's Ideals
-Over Z, the ideal generated by 2, written as (2) is the set of the multiples of 2
-The multiples of -2, denoted as (-2) is the same set.
-The ideal generated by 2 and 10, is the set of linear combinations of 2 and 10.
 -because 2 divides 10, this is again the same set (2)
-(2,3) = {2n + 3m : n,m in Z} = (1) = Z because 3 - 2 = 1, i.e. 1 is contained in (2,3) and (1) 
 generates Z
-A product of ideals such as (2)(3) is defined as smallest rng inside the ring that contains all 
 the products of elements from (2) and (3). It's given by (6)
-This ideal stuff redefines factorization of numbers into primes into factorizations of ideals into
 prime ideals
-In the integers, these factorizations are excatly the same (because they are a UFD?)
-in a non-UFD...

commutative rings                 has commutative multiplication
integral domains                  a product is zero only if one of the factors is zero
integrally closed domains         are complicated
GCD domains                       any two elements have a greatest common divisor
unique factorization domains      aka UFD, factorial ring, unique factorization is possible for 
                                  every element (except units and zero)
principal ideal domains           every ideal is principal
Euclidean domains                 division with remainder is possible
fields                            multiplicative inverses exist
algebraically closed fields       every non-const polynomial has a root

but in my definition which doesn't require a ring to have an identity, the first two lines should 
be

rings
unital rings

what about divison rings? integral domain sounds like that? no zero divisors?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_ring
a - no - it's a field but not necesarrily commutative. it doesn't fit into this this subbset chain
because it includes commutative rings higher above


maybe this should appearn in the section about fields
