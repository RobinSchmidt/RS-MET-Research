Pythagorean triples:
-integer triples (a,b,c) that satisfy a^2 + b^2 = c^2
-let n > m >= 1, gcd(n,m) = 1, n+m odd (i.e. not n and m both even or both odd)
-then (a,b,c) = k * (n^2 - m^2, 2*n*m, n^2 + m^2) gives all the Pythagorean triples up to swapping 
 a and b.
-for k = 1, we get the simple triples that are not just a multiple of another such triple
-proof of this is highly nontrivial
-real solutions are easy to find: just pick a,b and use c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) but finding integer 
 solutions was hard.

Rng: 
-not number systems but generalizations of multiples of a number
-important mostly as substructure of a ring

Z[i]
-smallest ring over z that contains i
-units ar e+-1, +-i
-every number except zero has 4 numbers that are associated with one another, example:
 7, -7, 7i, -7i  or  2 + 3i, 2 - 3i, -2 + 3i, -2 - 3i
-2 is not a prime anymore, it factors as: 2 = (1+i)(1-i)
-neither is 5: 5 = (1+2i)(1-2i)
-a^2 + b^2 = (a+bi)(a-bi). Factoring this sum of squares into linear factors was impossible over Z
-Z[i] can be used to find the pythagorean triples

Z[2] = Z

Z[1/2]:
-we need 1/2, 7/2, 1/4, -57/16, i.e. all numbers of the form a / 2^n where a is an integer and n is
 a positive integer. We could allow n to be positive too but that would only generate elements that 
 are already there.
-powers of 2 are units of this ring
-called dyadic rationals or binary rationals
 -used to store floating point numbers in a computer
 
Z[1/2, 1/3, 1/5, 1/7, 1/11, ...] = Q
R[i] = C

Z[sqrt(-3)] = Z[sqrt(3)i]
-invented by Euler as first of these systems to solve Fermat's last theorem for the case n = 3, i.e.
 to show that a^3 + b^3 = c^3 has no nontrivial integer solutions (but only solutions in this ring?)
-He needed to factor an expression of the form u^2 + 3*v^2. In Z[sqrt(-3)] , we have
 u^2 + 3*v^2 = (u + sqrt(-3) v) (u - sqrt(-3) v) 
-His proof was wrong though, because the factorization of numbers down to primes need to be unique 
 and this is not the case in this ring.
-For example, 4 factors in 2 ways: 4 = 2*2 = (1 - sqrt(-3)) (1 + sqrt(-3))
 [actually there are also 4 = (-2)*(-2) and perhaps also (-1 - sqrt(-3)) (-1 + sqrt(-3))?]
-This ring is *not* a unique factorization domain

4th roots of 1:
-are given by 1, i, -1, -i
-are all on the unit circle and split it into 4ths
-smallest ring over Z that contains all these is Z[i]

3rd roots of 1:
-given by 1, w, w^2 where w = -1/2 + i * sqrt(3)/2 = e^(2 pi i / 3)
-split the circle into thirds
-smallest ring over Z containing these is Z[w]
-contains lattice points of a lattice made from equilateral triangles
-this ring is called Eisenstein integers
-has 6 units: 1, -1, w, w^2, -w, -w^2
-contains sqrt(-3), too and therefore everything in Z[sqrt(-3)]
-here, u^2 + 3*v^2 = (u + sqrt(-3) v) (u - sqrt(-3) v)  factors uniquely. 
-4 still factors in the same 2 ways as before, BUT: over this ring, the two ways are not really 
 considered different anymore because the two ways are associated with each other, i.e. rotated 
 versions of the same number
 -The factorization is now indeed unique up to pulling out units (these units are NOT present in
  in Z[sqrt(-3)].
 -This is analog to 4 factoring into (-2)*(-2) as well
-This patches Euler's false proof
-a^3 + b^3 = (a + b) (a^2 - ab + b^2) = (a + b) (a + bw) (a + bw^2)
 -> it factors into linear factors which is crucial step in Gauss' proof of a^3 + b^3 = c^3 has no 
 integer solutions
 
a^4 + b^4 = c^4:
-Can be proven in a similar way using the Gaussian integers
-Can also be proven in an elementary way by writing it as:
 (a^2)^2 + (b^2)^2 = (c^2)^2
-The problem is now reframed as: can there be a Pythagoreran triple in which a,b,c are all square 
 numbers.
-4 is the only composite number for which this needs to be checked seperately
-for all other composite numbers, because take for example n = 30, we can write the eq as:
 (a^10)^3 + (b^10)^3 = (c^10)^3
 which can only be true, if the eq can also be solve for n=3, i.e. existence of solutions for n=3
 is a necesarry (but not suffient) condition for the eq to be true.
-n=2 is the only number for which the necesarry condition is actually true.
-we have to check only for the case n=4 seperately and then for primes. All other composite numbers
 will have a prime factorization with at least 4 = 2^2 or some prime p > 2 in it, so we can always 
 pull out such an outer prime exponent to arrive a a necesarry condition
