\subsection{Unrestricted Comprehension Axiom [VERIFY!]}
In naive set theory, there is one simple and very general axiom that allows us to construct sets. Let $x$ be any kind of object and $P(x)$ a predicate, i.e. a function into which we can plug in $x$ and then $P$ will return a boolean value that tells us whether or not $x$ has some property. With $P$ in hand, we can build the set $S = \{x: P(x)\}$ of all objects that satisfy our predicate. That we can always do this, for any $P$ whatsoever, is called the \emph{unrestricted comprehension} axiom, sometimes also \emph{naive comprehension} axiom. 

\subsection{Paradoxes}
It turns out that this is a bit too liberal. With unrestricted comprehension, we can build paradoxical sets...TBC...

\subsubsection{Russel's Paradox}
Define the Russel set\footnote{I think, it's actually not a \emph{set} but a \emph{proper class}? Verify!} $R$ as the set of all sets that do not contain themselves as an element. That means $R = \{x: x \notin x\}$. That means $x \in R \Leftrightarrow x \notin x$, i.e. $x$ is an element of $R$ if and only if $x$ is not an element of $x$. Here, $x$ can be \emph{any} set - so for any set $x$ whatsoever, we can ask the question whether or not it is an element of $R$. Now ask what happens when we let $x = R$, i.e. we ask whether or not $R$ is an element of $R$. From $x \in R \Leftrightarrow x \notin x$ with $x = R$, we immediately get the contradiction $R \in R \Leftrightarrow R \notin R$. That is obviously nonsensical. So what went wrong?

\paragraph{Solution} Apparently, when allowing to construct sets in such a completely unrestricted way, we can create paradoxical situations. The culprit lies in the assumption that sets can contain themselves as elements in the first place. Maybe we should disallow situations where $x \in x$ altogether. That seems to be a weird and counterintuitive situation anyway. We should perhaps even disallow a bit more - things like $x \in y \wedge y \in x$ or $x \in y \wedge y \in z \wedge z \in x$, etc. - i.e. disallow all recursive element relations that loop back on themselves (of which $x \in x$ is the simplest one). Ruling out such looped recursive element inclusions will later be formalized as the axiom of foundation VERIFY!...TBC...maybe we need also the axiom of restricted comprehension and/or the axiom of pairing?

% Axiom schema of specification (or of separation, or of restricted comprehension)

%Now ask: Is $R$ itself an element of $R$ or not? There are two possible answers to this question: either $R \in R$ or $R \notin R$. Let's assume that $R \notin R$, i.e. R does not contain itself as element. Then, by definition of $R$, $R$ should be an element of $R$. If, on the other hand, we assume that $R \in R$, then $R$ should not be an element of $R$.

%Let $R$ be the set of all sets that does not contain itself as element. Now ask: "is $R$ and element of $R$ or not?

%...TBC...ToDo: explain how the paradox follows from unrestricted (naive) comprehension and how it can be fixed (I think, we need the axiom of foundation which (together with the axiom of pairing) forbids that sets can be elements of themselves)

\subsubsection{Cantor's Paradox}
Calling Cantor's initial approach to set theory "naive" might be a bit unfair to him. He was, in fact, aware that his initial approach has some problems and came up with a paradoxon himself. It is actually a generalized version of Russel's paradox (VERIFY!)...TBC...
%We should not get the impression that Cantor himself was totally "naive"


\subsection{Systems of Axioms}

% -axioms describe
%  -what sets exist
%  -how to build new sets from existing sets - what is and what isn't allowed


\subsubsection{Zermelo, Fraenkel, Choice}
The most commonly used system of axioms that mathematicians use today is the one proposed by Zermelo and Frankel together with the so called axiom of choice. This system of axioms is usually called the ZFC system (for Zermelo, Fraenkel, Choice). ...TBC...

\section{Numbers as Sets}
In set theory, sets are the only thing that exists. Every mathematical object must somehow be viewed as some sort of set. To do all the cool math things that we love (or hate) so much, we obviously need numbers. So, we somehow need to build numbers from sets. Set theorists will talk about things like subsets of a number. This will at first sound totally nonsensical - what the heck is a subset of $10$ or $3/7$ or $\pi$ supposed to mean? But in set theory, numbers indeed \emph{are} sets (and therefore can have subsets) and we need to get used to this point of view.

%because we usually do not envision a number as a set.

\subsubsection{Cardinal Arithmetic}
The cardinal numbers are superset of the natural numbers. With natural numbers, we can do certain arithmetic operations, namely addition, multiplication and exponentiation. It is possible to extend these operations to the infinite cardinals...TBC...

\section{Theorems and Hypotheses}

\subsection{The Cantor-Bernstein Theorem}
To show that two sets $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality, we must, by definition, show that a bijection between $A$ and $B$ exists. The Cantor-Bernstein theorem asserts that it suffices to show that and injection from $A$ to $B$ and an injection from $B$ to $A$ exists. If these two injections exist, then the theorem assures that also a bijection between $A$ and $B$ exists. (VERIFY) Constructing these two injections (or indirectly showing that they exist) can, in some situations, be easier than showing directly that a bijection exists, so the theorem may help us to show that two sets have the same cardinality. ...TBC...

% I think, the theorem can be derived by (VERIFY!):
% -If there exists an injective function f: A to B  then  |A| <= |B|
% -If there exists an injective function f: B to A  then  |B| <= |A|
% -If both exist, then |A| <= |B| and |B| <= |A| and therefore  |A| = |B|

\subsection{The Continuum Hypothesis}
We know that $|\mathbb{N}| < |\mathbb{R}|$. The cardinality of the real (i.e. continuous) numbers is strictly greater than the cardinality of the natural numbers. Cantor observed that any infinite subset of the real numbers that he could construct had either the same cardinality as $\mathbb{R}$ itself or the same cardinality as $\mathbb{N}$, so he hypothesized that no cardinality in between these two exists (VERIFY!). This is called the \emph{continuum hypothesis} which is sometimes abbreviated as CH.  ....TBC...

%$\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\aleph_0}$. CH: $\aleph_1 = 2^{\aleph_0}$?

% ToDo: introduce notation \mathfrak{c}

\subsubsection{Independence from ZFC}
The quest was now to figure out whether or not the continuum hypothesis is true or false. As usual in axiomatic set theory, in order to prove a hypothesis true or false, one has only the axioms and the logical inference rules to work with (along with, of course, all the lower level theorems that have already been proven). So, the question in more precise terms asks: can we prove the continuum hypothesis true or false, given the ZFC axioms (or any other set of axioms). Kurt Gödel proved in 1940 that from ZFC, it cannot be proved that the continuum hypothesis is false. Paul Cohen proved in 1963 that from ZFC, it cannot be proved that the continuum hypothesis is true. These two results together mean that the continuum hypothesis is actually \emph{independent} from the ZFC axioms. This is sometimes also phrased as being \emph{undecidable} in ZFC. ...TBC...
