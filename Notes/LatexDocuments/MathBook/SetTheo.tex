%The Axiom of Choice | Epic Math Time
%https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnt4hyJYfGA
%-Shows how axiom of choice is used to show that every surjection f has a right inverse g
% such that f(g(y)) = y for all y in Y without explicitly specifying what g does. The proof leaves
% the task of picking an x in X for each y in Y (such that g(y) = x, f(x) = y) to the reader. Take 
% as example f(x) = x^2, compare the proof to the simpler proof for the bijective f(x) = x^3
