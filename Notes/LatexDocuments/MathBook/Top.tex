\chapter{Topology}
Topology can be described as the study of those properties of geometric objects that are preserved under continuous deformations of the object. An example of such a property is the number of holes that it has: a sphere has none, a torus has one. There are also shapes that have two, three, etc.. That number is such a topological property. You may continuously deform the object as much as you like - the number of holes will remain the same. Intuitively, for such a deformation to qualify as "continuous", it shall not rip or cut apart material, poke holes into it, glue things together that formerly were apart, close holes, etc. Mathematically, the class of allowed deformations is defined in terms of \emph{a topology} which is a specific set of subsets of a set $S$. Note how the term "topology" is overloaded as referring to two things: to the mathematical field itself and to a particular mathematical definition of a set of a certain kind that is used within that field. Such a topology will allow us to define continuity in a way that doesn't rely on a distance measure. Central to the field of topology are homeomorphisms which are invertible functions between two topological spaces which are continuous in both directions. In this context, the "topological spaces" are interpreted as geometric shapes and the function transforms one shape into another.
