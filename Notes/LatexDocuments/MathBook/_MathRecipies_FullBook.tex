%\chapter{Geometry}
% maybe this fits best directly after Linear Algebra as application thereof, so maybe place Calculus before Linear Algebra but maybe if we also compute areas of shapes via integrals, calculus needs to be introduced before geometry as well...maybe be a bit more general and include some (basic) calculusly stuff like areas and volumes, optimization of shapes (cylindrical can with smallest surface area kind of stuff)..no multivariable calculus, though - that's for later. but maybe introduce bivectors and trivectors already - they are simple and intuitive and will be needed for exterior algebra

\include{Bibliography}  

\begin{comment}

ToDo:
-Hyperlinks should appear in blue
-Make glossary for symbols and abbreviations 
 CR  - Cauchy-Riemann (semi standard)
 DG  - Differential Geometry (non standard)
 LHS - left hand side (standard)
 LSE - linear system of equations (non-standard)
 ODE - ordinary differential equation (standard)
 PDE - partial differential equation (standard)
 RHS - right hand side (standard)
 i.e. - "it est", latin for "that means" or "which means"
 e.g. - ?  for example
-Make a chapter dependency graph

-Maybe at the end of each section, put a little summary which may contain the most 
 important formulas as well. Length of the text (without) should be 1 or 2 pages.
-After the summary, also include a section with "Further Reading" that gives keywords and previews
 an references for more in depth study of the topic
-Maybe give algorithms in pseudocode and have actual working implementations in C++ in some repo
 that is supplementary to the book

-a^2 + a^2 = 2 a^2 = c^2 has no solutions bcs the lhs has a single factor of 2 whereas all
 other factors of the rhs and lhs must occur an even number of times due to the square. This
 can be generalized: k a^n = c^n can have no solutions for any k and any n by a similar 
 argument

Probability Theory:
-write Bayes' Theroem as P(P)*P(A|B) = P(A)*P(B|A)

Maybe define a latex environment for questions
