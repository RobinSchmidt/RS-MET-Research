In order to be able to render the LaTex documents with all the figures, you'll first need to render
the plots and put the results into this folder. In the ReadMe.txt in the parent folder, you'll
find more elaborate instructions for this. If the all the info is in this other ReadMe a level 
higher, you may wonder why this ReadMe.txt then even exists. It's main purpose is to convince git to 
accept the otherwise empty folder to exist in the repo because git doesn't allow for empty folders,
