\section{Preview}
In this paper, I propose a way to boil down the 4D information content of analytic functions into a 3D object without any loss of information. The key to this is the observation that analytic functions satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations which implies that their so called Polya vector fields are potential fields. A potential field is a vector field that can be obtained from a scalar field, called its potential, by way of taking partial derivatives. It turns out that the Cauchy-Riemann equations imply that the Polya vector field of an analytic function is indeed such a special potential field. We can therefore construct the potential of the Polya vector field which I will call the "Polya potential". Such a Polya potential is a function $p: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, i.e. a function with two real input and one real output - all in all an object that lives in 3D space rather than in 4D as the original complex function does. It is therefore simpler than the original 4D function and easier to visualize. Yet, it contains the full information. We can always reconstruct our original complex function from it. I propose to make that Polya potential an object of investigation and I hope that, besides helping in visualizing complex functions, it may also suggest new ways of analyzing them. I'm not sure, if that idea is any new - but if it isn't, then information about that is not so easy to find on the internet (or my search skills are lacking). The Polya vector fields seem to be moderately well known - but their potentials seem to be, so far, largely ignored. I propose that we should take a closer look at them. To facilitate this, I will derive expressions for the Polya potentials of many important elementary functions, state some rules for how to derive such expressions for more complicated functions when they are expressed as power series and I'll explain how to interpret plots of such Polya potentials. 

\section{Analytic Functions}
Complex functions $f$ are functions that map a complex number $z$ to another complex number $w$. We will write this as $w = f(z)$. Both, input $z$ and output $w$, are two-dimensional entities such that plotting the graph of such a complex function $f$ would require four dimensions. That makes visualization of complex functions challenging for us lowly creatures that inhabit a 3D space. However, most complex functions of interest have a special property that allows us to boil these 4D objects down to 3D objects without any loss of information. That property is called "analyticity" also known as "holomorphy". These two terms are actually defined differently but in the context of complex analysis they imply each other, so they are often used interchangably [VERIFY!]. If we consider only functions that are analytic (or holomorphic), we are dealing with an important subset of all possible complex functions $f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. That subset is so rigidly constrained that it is actually possible to construct a function $p: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that captures the full information content of our original $f$. This "rigidity" of analytic functions is captured in the  Cauchy-Riemann equations which relate real and imaginary part of a complex function in a way that severely constrains, what the analytic function can do. It is this rigidity that we exploit to boil down a 4D object into a 3D object without information loss.

\section{Polya Vector Fields}
When we interpret the complex conjugate of a complex function $f$ as a vector field, we obtain the so called Polya vector field that is associated with the complex function. Due to the analyticity of $f$, this vector field will be potential field. That means, there exists a scalar field, called a potential, such that the vector field can be obtained from it by taking partial derivatives. More formally, the Polya vector field of a complex function $f = f(z): \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, is a 2D vector field, i.e. a function $(u(x,y), v(x,y)): \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ that is obtained from the complex function $f$ by using $u(x,y) = \Re(f), v(x,y) = -\Im(f)$ where $x = \Re(z), y = \Im(z)$. Negating the imaginary part of $f$ in the definition $v$ has the effect of turning the Cauchy-Riemann conditions for analytic complex functions into the condition that makes the Polya vector field curl-free (by virtue of $u_y = v_x$) and divergence-free (by virtue of $u_x = - v_y$). To avoid confusion, note that in my notation here, I use $v(x,y) = -\Im(f)$ whereas in a typical complex analysis textbook, you're are more likely to see things like $f(z) = f(x + \i y) = u(x,y) + \i v(x,y)$, i.e. $v(x,y) = \Im(f)$. Without the negation, the Cauchy-Riemann equations would look like $u_x = v_y, u_y = -v_x$ and that's how you'll see them in textbooks. But for our purposes here, where we are dealing with the Polya vector field, it is more convenient to have the negation already baked into $v$. So, the Cauchy-Riemann equations look like $u_x = -v_y, u_y = v_x$ with our notation here. The curl-free condition $u_y = v_x$ makes the Jacobian of the Polya vector field symmetric and in turn, a symmetric Jacobian is a necessary and sufficient condition for the vector field to be a gradient field, i.e. a vector field that can be obtained from a scalar field by the operation of taking its gradient. Symmetry of the Jacobian is in itself already enough to make the vector field a gradient field. But we have a further constraint: the divergence-free property $u_x = -v_y$ lets our Jacobian have a trace (sum of diagonal elements) of zero. Our vector field is not just any arbitrary gradient field but a very special kind of gradient field - namely, one that is divergence-free. 

\section{Polya Potentials}
In general, a potential $p(x,y)$ for a given 2D vector field $u(x,y), v(x,y)$ is a scalar field whose partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ are equal to our two given bivariate functions $u$ and $v$ that define our vector field. That means $p$ must be such that $u = \partial p / \partial x = p_x$ and $v = \partial p / \partial v = p_y$. Our intention here is, of course, to let $u,v$ be the real and negated imaginary part of a complex function $f(z) = f(x + \i y)$, i.e. the Polya vector field of $f$. The potential for the Polya vector field of a complex function $f(z)$ is what I call the "Polya potential" of the complex function $f$. So, given $u$ and $v$ and assuming that $u,v$ indeed define a potential field, how do we find a potential $p(x,y)$ for our pair of bivariate functions? The equation $u = p_x$ suggests that to  find $p$, we might integrate $u$ with respect to $x$. In the following, "with respect to" will be abbreviated as "wrt". Also, the equation $v = p_y$ suggests that we might integrate $v$ wrt $y$. So does that mean we can choose either of the two ways and both will give us the same result? In some cases, it does indeed work out like that. But there's a little complication: In both integrations, there could be integration constants and these "constants" are actually constant only wrt our integration variable but can depend on the other variable. To take this into account, we may evaluate both of these integrals. All of their terms that depend on both $x$ and $y$ should match but we may get extra terms that depend only on $x$ when integrating $u$ wrt $x$ and other extra terms that depend only on $y$ when integrating $v$ wrt $y$. These "extra terms" are the desired integration "constants". What we have to do is to collect all the common terms that depend on $x$ and $y$ and add to the that the extra terms that depend only on $x$ or only on $y$ from both results to get our final expression for $p(x,y)$. In some cases, these extra terms turn out to be zero but at other times they are not. This will become clearer when we see examples.

\section{Polya Vector Fields and Potentials of Elementary Functions}
Now we want to build a little inventory of expressions for Polya vector fields and their potentials for some important elementary functions. The way I want to do this is by using a little snippet of SageMath code into which we can plug in our function of interest $f(z)$ and it spits out expressions for the components $u,v$ of the associated Polya vector field and the integrals of $u$ and $v$ with respect to $x$ or $y$ from which we can read off our Polya potential $p(x,y)$. You can execute that snippet yourself in SageCell \cite{SageCell}. In the example code, we consider the function $f(z) = z^2$.
\begin{verbatim}
var("x y")
assume(x, "real")
assume(y, "real")
z = x + I*y
w = z^2                 # function of interest
u =  w.real() 
v = -w.imag()
U = integral(u, x)
V = integral(v, y)
u, v, U, V	
\end{verbatim}
This produces the result:
\begin{verbatim}
(x^2 - y^2, -2*x*y, 1/3*x^3 - x*y^2, -x*y^2)
\end{verbatim}
In this example, we indeed see that $U$, the integral of $u$ wrt $x$, does indeed contain a term that depends only on $x$ but not on $y$, namlely $x^3/3$. That is the function of $x$ that would have to be added as integration "constant" to $V$ to give the full potential. The term that depends on both $x$ and $y$, namely $-x y^2$, is the same in $U$ and $V$, as it should be. So, we found the desired expressions for our Polya vector field for the complex function $f(z) = z^2$. They are:
\begin{equation}
f(z) = z^2: \quad 
u(x,y) = x^2 - y^2, \; 
v(x,y) = -2 x y, \quad 
p(x,y) = \frac{x^3}{3} -x y^2
\end{equation}
Replacing the line \texttt{w = z\textasciicircum2 } by some other function, say \texttt{w = exp(z)}, we can get the expressions for other fucntions of interest. For $f(z) = e^z$, the result is:
\begin{verbatim}
(cos(y)*e^x, -e^x*sin(y), cos(y)*e^x, cos(y)*e^x)
\end{verbatim}




%In this context, the scalar field whose gradient our vector field is, is called the (scalar) potential of the vector field. In fact, the Jacobian of the vector field is just the Hessian of the potential. The potential for the Polya vector field of a complex function $f(z)$ is what I call the "Polya potential" of the complex function and it's an object that I have not yet seen as being used in complex analysis. Maybe taking a closer look at it can reveal some new insights. The goal is to derive expressions for the Polya potential of the zeta function and then analyze this Polya potential instead of the zeta function itself. I hope that it will turn out to be simpler to understand because its just a simple scalar field over $\mathbb{R}^2$, i.e. a 3D thing rather than a 4D one - but it contains nonetheless the same amount of information. We have taken advantage of the analyticity of zeta to achieve a dimensionality reduction of the problem. The all important zeros of the zeta function will be mapped to the stationary points of its Polya potential. Stationary points of a scalar field are points, where the gradient vanishes. In general, there are three types of such stationary poinrs: minima, maxima and saddle points. Experiments suggest that in the case of Polya potentials of complex functions, only saddles occur [I think, this might be a consequence of the additional divergence-free property - figure out!]. The Polya potential is a surface in 3D space, so it is also amenable to the tools of differential geometry like figuring out main curvature directions at the stationary points, figuring out the geodesics between the stationary points, etc.. Polya potentials give us a new angle of attack to analyze complex functions and, of course, to visualize them to hopefully build some intuition.

-This paper is supposed to factor out all the general Polya-potential stuff from the paper
 about the Polya potnetial of the Riemann zeta function such that it can eventually be removed
 from there.
