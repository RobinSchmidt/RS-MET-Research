Formulas:

  Z(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}

Ideas:

-Consider the Polya vector field of zeta and compute its potential P(x,y). Then, the zeros of zeta 
 corrspond to the stationary points (minima, maxima or saddles) of P. Maybe that could be easier to
 deal with than zeta itself because it's just a bivariate scalar function?

-To compute the potential, I think, we can just compute the potential of a single term in the sum 
 form and then add up all these potentials. Potentials superimpose linearly, I think.

The Dream: Riemann Hypothesis and F1 (RH Saga S1E1)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTCE2SXguwU
-stuff on the theory of L-functions
-uses sage for some bits
-makes the connection to the "Riemann spectrum" clear (at around 15 min, it gets interesting), shows
 the peaks at the primes of a sum of (logarithmic) cosine waves when their freqs are given by the 
 zeros of zeta. 
-at 19:07, it has a couple of books on the topic. And htis paper by Brian Conrey:

# Sage code for generating the zeros:

spectrum = zeta_zeros()
for k in range(10):
    print(spectrum[k])

-------------------------------------------------
# Sage code for plotting the superposition of 
# Riemann waves:
 
m = 20             # maximum for the plot
n = 200            # number of terms to use
z = zeta_zeros()   # a generator?

def wave(x):
  s = 0
  for i in range(n):
    s = s - cos(z[i] * log(x))
  return s

P = plot(wave(x), 0, m, ymin=0)
P.show(figsize=[20,5])

It seems to have peaks at prime powers p^k, too - with height 1/k? ...nah. At 1 is the biggest spike 
but there are spikes below 1, too - apparently, at the reciprocals of the primes? Yep - seems so. 
Maybe a plot with logarithmic x-axis could make sense. Maybe plot it from 1/m to m in this case. 
This should compensate for the frequency drop of the harmonics. To make sense of the freq-sweep,
re-express the log(x) argument as log(x) = x * w(x)  ->  w(x) = log(x)/x  where w(x) is the radian
frequency in terms of x. It looks like this:
