Start by creating two spectra additively, then multiply these two signals. The product will contain
partials at all sum and difference frequencies of the factors. The question is, if we are given a
target spectrum, how can we find the required frequencies in the two factors. Let's call the two
factor spectra A and B and the product P. Let's call the target spectrum T and the number of 
partials in A and B are denoted by nA and nB.


Examples:

T: 100,200, nA = 1, nB = 1 
A: 50, B: 150
P: 100,200 -> success

T: 100,200,300,400, nA = 1, nB = 2
A: 50, B: 150,350
P: 100,200, 300,400 -> success  

T: 100,200,300,400,500,600, nA = 1, nB = 3
A: 50, B: 150,350,550
P: 100,200, 300,400, 500,600 -> success (freqs are grouped according to freqs from B)

T: 100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800 nA = 2, nB = 2
A: 50,150, B: 350,650
P: 300,400,200,500, 600,700,500,800 -> fail: 100 is missing, 500 occurs twice
A: 50,150, B: 250,650
P: 200,300,100,400, 600,700,500,800 -> success
A: 50,250, B: 350,550
P: 300,400,100,600, 500,600,300,800 -> fail: 200,700 missing, 300,600 twice

Rules:
-The total number nP of partials in P generated from A*B equals 2*nA*nB, but the frequencies of all 
 these partials are not necessarily distinct. In fact, our goal is to find useful rules under which
 we can make them distinct (while being harmonically related, too).
-The highest freq in P is the sum of the two highest freqs from A and B.
-When T is harmonic and A has only one partial, we need to arrange the partials of B to fall in 
 between the desired harmonics of P. A should be half of the difference between the harmonics, 
 i.e. half the fundamental. The difference between partials in B has to be two times the 
 fundamental.
-The previous rule may perhaps be harnessed by generating a signal by successively multiplying the
 output of the previous multiplication stage with a single sinusoidal partial. At each stage, the
 number of frequencies in the output would potentially double (unless generated partials happen
 to coincide).
-If the same frequency occurs in A and in B, P will have a DC component
 
Ideas:
-Maybe instead of just doing P = A*B, we could do P = wA*A + wB*B + wAB*A*B where wA,wB,wAB are 
 weights. wA = wB = 0, wAB = 1 would reduce to the P = A*B case. The number of output partials in P
 would be nP = 2*nA*nB + nA + nB, so the spectrum would get denser even faster after a couple of
 multiplication stages.
 
Let's denote A + B + A*B = A +* B, sets of partial frequencies are denoted braces. With this 
notation, we can write:
 
{50} +* {150} = {50, 100, 150, 200}
{25} +*  {50, 100, 150, 200} = {25,50,75(2),100,125(2),150,175(2),200,225}

so with 3 oscillators at 150,50,25, we obtain 12 partials, 9 of which have distinct frequencies and 
they from a nice and complete harmonic series. If we detune the 25 slightly, say, to 26, the 
frequencies that appear twice will show beating

what about (1+A)*B = B + A*B or (1+B)*A = A + A*B
