0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
5 2 1 7 6 9 4 3 8 0

can be written as:

(0 5 9)(1 2)(3 7)(4 6)(8)

To prodcue this representation, we start at 0 and look where it maps to (which is 5) then look 
where 5 maps to (which is 9), then look where 9 maps to (which is 0) at which point we recognize 
that 0 was our start value, so we found one cycle. Then, we find the next number which has not 
yet been visited (which is 1) and do the same process. ..and so on, until all numbers have been 
covered. In the example, the permutation consisted of 1 cycle of length 3, 3 cycles of length 2 and
1 cycle of length 1. The length 1 cycles can be left out from the notation, since they represent
elements which map to themselves. The identity can be written as (1) or as (). The composition of 
the so extrcated cycles is commutative because the cycles are disjoint - each cycle operates on a 
different subset of the original set, so they don't interfere with one another. The representation
as cycles shows more clearly the structure of the permutation and makes it possible to perform the
permutation in at most N steps without additional memory. We just work through each cycle from 
right to left. Consider the cycle:

(4 2 3 1 0)

We can break it down into the sequence of transpositions (swaps):

(1 0)(3 1)(3 2)(4 0)   (verify that)

The set of permutations of N elements is a group and any group with N elements is isomorphic to a
subgroup of that group (Cayley's theorem). This means that anything there is to know about finite 
groups can be figured out by studying permutation groups - they encompass all other finite groups.
