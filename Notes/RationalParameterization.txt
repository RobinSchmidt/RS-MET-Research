We assume that we have an implicit definition of an algebraic variety given and we want to find a
rational parameterization for that. There is a recipe for that which sometimes works. We'll see it
in action on the example of the unit circle defined by the equation:

  x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0
  
That's our implict definition of the variety. What we want to find is a pair of rational functions
x(t), y(t) that parameterize our given variety. 

Our first step it to find some convenient fixed point P on the variety which has rational 
coordiantes. We will pick the point 

  P = (0,1) 
  
to be our fixed point. Next, we pick a variable second point Q. It should be chosen such that when 
we connect P and Q by a straight line, this line should intersect our circle in a second point (the
line will always intersect (or at least be tangent to) the circle in P). It is this second point of
intersection, whose coordinates we want to figure out. The point should be made variable by our 
parameter t in such a way that, when t sweeps out some interval of values, the second point of 
intersection will sweep out our circle. We will chose the point Q to be a point on the x-axis with 
its x-coordinate being equal to t. That is:

  Q = (t,0)
  
Next, we look at the line that connects P and Q. That line can be given parametrically as:

  L(s) = ((1-s)*P, s*Q)

where it is important to note that the parameter that parameterizes the line, namely s, is a 
different variable than our eventual parameter t that we wnat to use in our rational 
parameterization (that really confused me initially). Our parametric line can be split into its x-
and y-component:

  x(s) = (1-s)*P_x + s*Q_x = (1-s)*0 + s*1 = s
  y(s) = (1-s)*Q_x + s*Q_y = (1-s)*t + s*0 = t - s*t
  
Now we want to figure out a value of s, such that the point (x(s), y(s)) satisfies our circle 
equation  x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0. So we plug in the coordinate functions x(s), y(s) into the equation:

  0 = (x(s))^2 + (y(s))^2 - 1
  0 = s^2 + (t-s*t)^2 - 1 
  0 = s^2 + t^2 - 2*s*t^2 + s^2*t^2 - 1 
  
  
  
which gives:  
  
  = 0

-use the same method to find a rational parameterization of an ellipsoid
