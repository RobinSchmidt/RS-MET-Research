We assume that we have an implicit definition of an algebraic variety given and we want to find a
rational parameterization for that. There is a recipe for that which sometimes works. We'll see it
in action on the example of the unit circle defined by the equation:

  x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0
  
That's our implict definition of the variety. What we want to find is a pair of rational functions
x(t), y(t) that parameterize our given variety. 

Our first step it to find some convenient fixed point P on the variety which has rational 
coordiantes. We will pick the point 

  P = (0,1) 
  
to be our fixed point. Next, we pick a variable second point Q. It should be chosen such that when 
we connect P and Q by a straight line, this line should intersect our circle in a second point (the
line will always intersect (or at least be tangent to) the circle in P). It is this seconc point of
intersection, whose coordinates we want to figure out. The point whould be maed variable by our 
parameter t in such a way that, when t sweeps out some interval of values, the second point of 
intersection will sweep out our circle.








ToDo:
-use the same method to find a rational parameterization of an ellipsoid
