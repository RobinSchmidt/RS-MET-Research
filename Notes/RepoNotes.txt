-I apparently once accidentally added a Thumbs.db file to the repo. That's a thumbnail file 
 generated by windows for preview purposes. It was in
   Prototypes\Cpp\Builds\VisualStudio2019
 I removed it, but its history may still be present. It was a 176 kB file (but i don't know, how 
 much space it takes with history)
 -it was apparently (according to github history) added on Apr 22, 2020, 
    hash: 4a6957e921b005a5e8493cba2dbae9e454ad5bfd, comment: "added sirp and manifold code" 
  and updated once on Oct 17, 2021,
    hash: b48d07d79c9a40ec250192e775ba69649987c7df, comment: "added testNewtonFractal stub" 
 -> try to figure out how to clean up the repo from the remnants (i.e. history) of this file. It's
    just a waste of space.
