Rave Hoover sound fo Roland Alpha Juno:

Seems like it is based on what they call a PWM-Saw which actually seems to be a sawtooth wave that 
is chopped (amplitude modulated) by a unipolar pulse-wave. ...maybe...mayby try to build a patch in 
Liberty that does this

Rain: 
 -highpass-filtered white noise (stereo)
 -maybe the underlying white noise should be bi-modal, emphasizing outliers

Wind:
 -lowpass-filtered white noise (stereo) with resonance
 -use random LFO (or maybe 2 or 3 Sinusoids with irrational frequency ratios) to      modulate cutoff (between 250 and 1000 Hz)
 -maybe use a stereo-delay (ping-pong, or something)

Flowing Water:
 -random filter blips, maybe
