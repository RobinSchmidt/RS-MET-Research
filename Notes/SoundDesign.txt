Rave Hoover sound of Roland Alpha Juno:

Seems like it is based on what they call a PWM-Saw which actually seems to be a sawtooth wave that 
is chopped (amplitude modulated) by a unipolar pulse-wave. ...maybe...mayby try to build a patch in 
Liberty that does this

Rain: 
 -highpass-filtered white noise (stereo)
 -maybe the underlying white noise should be bi-modal, emphasizing outliers

Wind:
 -lowpass-filtered white noise (stereo) with resonance
 -use random LFO (or maybe 2 or 3 Sinusoids with irrational frequency ratios) to      modulate cutoff (between 250 and 1000 Hz)
 -maybe use a stereo-delay (ping-pong, or something)

Flowing Water:
 -random filter blips, maybe


Noises:
-Use brickwall filtered noise. The brickwall filters produce ringing souch that it may sound very
 tonal despite being noisy when looking at the spectrum. For example, tune a highpass to 220 Hz and
 a lowpass to 880 Hz. Maybe produce a notch at 440 Hz. Or maybe use several parallel bandpasses. Or
 use steep bandreject filters. The "walls" should be tuned to musically relevant frequencies.


Cymbal sound design:
-"Exciter Stage": 
 -Use a filtered impulse as exciter (maybe try filtered enveloped noise, too)
-"Disperser-Stage":
 -Set up a comb-filter like feedback delay loop
 -Within the feedback loop, place various DSP elements:
  -Allpass filters, (e.g. a chain of PhaseNudge by Airwindows, Video uses 2), Creates dispersion.
  -Vibrato with lowpass noise as modulator (e.g. MVibrato by Melda). Creates the "wobbly" sound.
  -Phase-distortion self-phasemod (Kilohearts Phase Distortion). Creates "bloom" and "swell". "It 
   makes louder sounds brighter".
  -Maybe for the phase-distortion try: Allpass filter with coeff modulated by (filtered) input, 
   Delay with delaytime modulated by (filtered) input
  -My ideas for additional stuff in the feedback loop: Waveshaping (maybe (soft) bitcrushing,
   sinusoidal/multifold could perhaps replace the phase distortion), pitch-shifting, 
   frequency-shifting
-"Resonator-Bank Stage":
 -The output of the Disperser goes into the resonator bank which is...
 -A bunch of parallel comb filters (e.g. 4 instances of MComb by Melda each of which has 4 combs). 
  These combs can be tuned to desireable frequencies.
 -Make sure that the undelayed signal (i.e. direct signal from the disperser) doesn't bleed through.
  The video does this by some phase-cancellation trickery that he calls "dry nulling" but I think, I
  can set up my comb filters directly to produce only the delayed signal at the output.
 -The resonators may be individually EQed.
-See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=netcpYINyBQ 
 especially from 24:00 
 

Single-Cycle Waveforms:
-Fractalize waveforms:
 -Take a mother waveform and produce various decimated versions of it (by 2,4,8, etc.) and mix them
  (approriately pitch-shifted) with the original - the 4-fold decimated wave plays 2 octaves higher,
  etc. Mabye allow alternating phases between the octaves. I think, using a square wave with 
  alternating phases for the octaves and amplitudes of 1/n where n is the decimation factor, should
  produce magnitudes like a saw. This can be seen from observing that a saw can be constructed from
  a square and an (inverted) saw one octave higher (with half the amplitude). The same decomposition
  can then be applied to the higher saw as well, and so on. I think, it's equivalent to taking the 
  spectrum of a saw, then stepping through all even harmonics and inverting their phases, then 
  stepping through all harmonics that are multiples of 4 and inverting their phases back again, then
  stepping through the multiples of 8 and inverting again, etc.

WaveTables:
-Start with a sawtooth wave, randomize the phases and for each subsequent version of the waveform,
 randomize them slightly more. Or maybe take two sets of randomized phases and make a 
 phase-interpolation between the two settings over the wavetable. It's a "phase-morph"
