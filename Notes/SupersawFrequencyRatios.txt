Let's assume, the frequency ratios are given as rational numbers. We want an algorithm that takes 
as input two frequencies (or period lengths) a,b (both rationla numbers) and produces as output
an array of rational numbers c1,...,cN with c1=a, cN=b which should somehow minimize the beating
between all the different frequencies. ...or actually: sort of distribute the beating in a way that
makes it perceptually least obvious. 

Let ci = ni/di and let's assume that the ci are period lengths. If all denominators di would be 
one, we would like to maximize the lcm of all the ci (i think, if they are frequencies, we want 
to minimze the gcd?). If we allow for other denominators, we perhaps want to maximize 
lcm(n1,..,nN) / lcm(d1,..,dN)? But we need to put some constraints on the size of the numbers - 
otherwise, this maximization task would be unbounded. Maybe let's say that the maximum allowed 
denominator is dMax = d1*dN*N

We also want the average of the ci to be close (or even equal) to (a+b)/2.

Example: N=3, a = c1 = 6/5 = 1.2, b = cN = c3 = 5/4 = 1.25
dMax = d1*d3*N = 5*4*3 = 60, avg = (6/5 + 5/4)/2 = 49/40
let's use c2 = avg = 49/40, them we have:
k := lcm(6,5,49)/lcm(5,4,40) = 1470/40 = 147/4
we wnat the lcm of the numerators to be large, the lcm of the denominators be small and the
gcd of both lcms be small


OR:


Let's not restrict ourselves to rational numbers and let c1,..,cN be real numbers. Maybe choose
equidistant values between a^k and b^k and then take the k-th root afterwards. k is a user 
parameter (could even be 0 or negative - in case of 0, we choose exponential spacing). Or maybe 
choose numbers in a way so as to make their generalized mean (with exponent k) equal the same
generalized mean of a and b...could that give the same result?

Example: N=7, a=10, b=20, k=2
raise a,b to power of k:  a^2 = 100, b^2 = 400
create equidistant numbers: c1 = 100, c2=150, c3=200, c4=250, c5=300, c6=350, c7=400
raise to power 1/k: c1 = 10, c2 = 12.25, c3 = 14.14, c4 = 15.81, c5 = 17.32, c6 = 18.71, c7 = 20

...maybe compute the quadratic mean of these numbers and compare it to the quadratic mean of a,b.
Is it the same?
