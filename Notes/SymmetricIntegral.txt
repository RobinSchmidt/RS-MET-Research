Motivation:

Consider Cauchy distribution:

  p(x) = (1/(pi*g)) * g^2 / ((x-x0)^2 + g^2)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution
This probability density function has an undefined mean because the integral 
via which the mean is defined does not converge. ...at least not in the sense
of the limit of Riemann sums. Could we define a different notion of an 
integral that works for this function? I'm thinking about starting at some 
central point and going leftward and rightward simultaneously while adding up
the contributions. Let's consider the simpler version of the function:

  f(x) = 1 / (1 + x^2)
  
we want to find a suitable definition of:

  I = integral_{-inf}^{+inf} x * f(x) dx
  
Let's define a stepsize h and consider the sum

  S = sum_{n=-inf}^{+inf} h*f(c + n*h) + h*f(c - n*h)  -  h*f(c)
  
for some center value c. The last term is because the value for n=0 is counted 
twice otherwise (right?). If this sum converges for h->0 and any choice of c 
to the same finite value, we could take that as the definition for the 
integral. Actually, for h->0, the subtraction of h*f(c) is not necessary 
because that term goes to zero anyway (assuming f(c) is finite). Let's consider
the sum before taking the h->0 limit with c=0. In the case of the Cauchy 
distribution, as n goes to infinity, we add equal positive and negative 
contributions, so each term in the sum becomes zero, so the sum itself becomes 
zero. For more general c, it's a bit like an alternating series. It very much 
reminds me of the harmonic series with alternating signs - which indeed does 
converge.
