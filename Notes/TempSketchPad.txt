Anti-Aliasing Techniques:

Catalog of anti-aliasing techniques. Format: Name, Description, Applications, Pro, Con

- Oversampling. Pro: Universally applicable. Easy to implement. Con: Computationally expensive

- Additive Synthesis: Pro: High level of control. Con: Very expensive computationally. Limited
  area of application (synthesis of sinusoidal spectra). Using Chebychev polynomials, the idea can
  be partially extended to waveshaping.
 
- BLIT/BLEP/BLAMP (Bandlimited Impulse Train, Step, Ramp): Pro: Reasonably efficient. Con: 
  Applicable only to synthesis of waveforms with discontinuities (in the wave itself or one of its 
  derivatives and to the jumps in hard-sync)

- ADAA (Anti Derivative Anti-Aliasing): Applicable to waveshapers

- DSF (Discrete Summation Formulas):

- Lowpass filtering before downsampling. Applicable to waveform playback at higher speed.

- Mip-Mapping: Store various different precomputed versions of the signal which are progressively 
  more heavily lowpass filtered. These so called mip-maps can either be decimated according to their
  individual bandwidths or not. This is basically a precomputed/offline variant of the "lowpassing 
  before downsampling" technique  ...TBC...
  
- Magnitude Matching: Applicable to either anti-alias or decramp filter magnitude responses. Which
  of the two it is depends on what you consider as the baseline reference. Impulse invariant 
  designs have indeed aliased frequency responses such that calling it an anti-aliasing technique
  is somewhat appropriate (although the term is being bent a bit to include frequency response
  aliasing), bilinear transform based once show frequency warping.
  
- Parameter range limitation or reduction of parameters that control spectral brightness by the 
  fundamental frequency in various syntesis methods like FM, PD, etc. Pro: Easy to implement. Very
  efficient. Con: It's not proper anti-aliasing but actually just cheating. However, decreasing the
  brightness for higher notes can actually be natural and musical.

- Highpass filtering: Can get rid of aliasing components below the fundamental which tend to be 
  especially annoying. It's also more in the "cheating" territory using psychoacoustic masking 
  effects for the higher alias frequencies.

- Quantizing oscillator frequencies to those which have an integer number of samples in one cycle.
  Perhaps combined with internal resampling. Does not really get rid of the aliasing components but
  strategically places them on top of the already existing harmonic, making their impact far less
  objectionable. They only alter the amplitudes but do not introduce new frequency components.
  Pro: efficient, easy to implement, Con: very restrictive in what pitches are allowed.
  
- The "pitch quantization" method described above can be combined with (deterministic or 
  probabilistic) dithering to get back to the full frequency range - at the expense of introducing
  noise. This "pitch dithering" approach would pick two integer cycle lengths L1, L2 that straddle 
  the desired cycle length L and make sure that the _average_ cycle length equals the desired cycle  
  length by (probabilistically or determistically) alternating between cycles of lengths L1 and L2.
  
- Advanced interpolation techniques like (windowed) sinc interpolation. Theoretically, this ampounts
  to perfect resampling, i.e. going back to the continuous time domain and then back to a new 
  discrete time domain at a different sampling rate.
  
- Often combinations are used. For example, mip-mapping together with mild oversampling (e.g. 2x) or
  ADAA with moderate oversampling. Especially oversampling is often thrown in as secondary technique
  on top of another one.

ResoVerb or TuneVerb or ModalVerb:

- A reverb based on allpasses based on my parallel-comb-bank-allpass filter

- The resonances of the allpass can be adjusted to be musical notes such that we treat the "metallic
  resonances" as a desirable feature, not as a flaw.
  
- Maybe for each note we could tune 2 or 3 modal filters to slightly above and below in order to get
  sinusoidal undulations of amplitude. The frequency of these undulations, i.e. the frequency 
  difference between center freq and outer freqs may be different for each mode such that higher 
  modes modulate faster and qe get a complex overall modulation pattern.
  
- Maybe a similar idea can be applied to the comb filters in an FDN. Tune them to musical notes. 
  Maybe it can also be applied to old school serial allpasses / parallel combs structures, i.e. 
  Schroeder/Moorer reverbs.
