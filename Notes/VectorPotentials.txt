Given a 3D vector field defined by the 3 trivariate functions:

  f(x,y,z), g(x,y,z), h(x,y,z)

we want to find another vector field:

  F(x,y,z), G(x,y,z), H(x,y,z)

such that the curl of F,G,H equals f,g,h. The field F,G,H is called the vector 
potential of f,g,h. The necessarry and sufficient condition for such a vector 
potential to exist is that the divergence of f,g,h is zero. From the definition
of curl, we see that F,G,H must satisfy the 3 simultaneous equations:

  f = H_y - G_z, g = F_z - H_x, h = G_x - F_y

where H_y denotes the partial derivative of H with respect to y and so on 
(subscripts, symbolized by the underscore _, denote partial derivatives).
Vector potentials are not unique. We have some freedom of choice and we use it
to set H(x,y,z) = const which simplifies the equation system to:

  f = -G_z, g = F_z, h = G_x - F_y

The f,g equations lead to:

  G = -f^z + a(x,y), F = g^z + b(x,y)

where we use the superscript notation, subolized by the caret ^, to denote 
integration ("antidifferentiation") with respect to the superscripted 
variable, so f^z is f integrated with respect to z. With a(x,y), b(x,y), we
denote the integration "constants". They are constant only with respect 
to z but can still be functions of x and y. We can now compute the integrals 
f^z, g^z and are left with the task to figure out some appropriate integration
constants a = a(x,y), b = b(x,y) such that the third equation is satisfied:

  h = G_x - F_y 
    = (-f^z + a)_x - (g^z + b)_y 
    = (-f^z)_x + a_x - (g^z)_y + b_y
  
  h + f^z_x + g^z_y = a_x + b_y

This is one equation for the two unknown functions a_x, b_y. We have a 
again some freedom of choice and use it to set b_y = 0 which determines our
integration constants as:

  a_x = h + f^z_x + g^z_y
  b_y = 0

Integrating a_x with respect to x and b_y with respect to y gives our desired
functions:

  a = a(x,y) = a_x^x = (h + f^z_x + g^z_y)^x
  b = b(x,y) = b_y^y = 0^y = c(x)

where c(x) can be function of x but for simplicity, we can also set it to zero.
