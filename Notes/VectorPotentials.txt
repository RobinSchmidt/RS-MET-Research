Given a 3D vector field defined by the 3 trivariate functions:

  f(x,y,z), g(x,y,z), h(x,y,z)

we want to find another vector field:

  F(x,y,z), G(x,y,z), H(x,y,z)

such that the curl of F,G,H equals f,g,h. The field F,G,H is called the vector 
potential of f,g,h. The necessarry and sufficient condition for such a vector 
potential to exist is that the divergence of f,g,h is zero. From the definition
of curl, we see that F,G,H must satisfy the 3 simultaneous equations:

  f = H_y - G_z, g = F_z - H_x, h = G_x - F_y

where H_y denotes the partial derivative of H with respect to y and so on 
(subscripts, symbolized by the underscore _, denote partial derivatives).
Vector potentials are not unique. We have some freedom of choice and we use it
to set H(x,y,z) = const which simplifies the equation system to:

  f = -G_z, g = F_z, h = G_x - F_y

The f,g equations lead to:

  G = -f^z + a(x,y), F = g^z + b(x,y)

where we use the superscript notation, symbolized by the caret ^, to denote 
integration ("antidifferentiation") with respect to the superscripted 
variable, so f^z is f integrated with respect to z. This notation is motivated
by the subscript notation for partial derivatives. With a(x,y), b(x,y), we
denote the integration "constants". They are constant only with respect 
to z but can still be functions of x and y. We can now compute the integrals 
f^z, g^z and are left with the task to figure out some appropriate integration
constants a = a(x,y), b = b(x,y) such that the third equation is satisfied:

  h = G_x - F_y 
    = (-f^z + a)_x - (g^z + b)_y 
    = (-f^z)_x + a_x - (g^z)_y + b_y
  
  h + f^z_x + g^z_y = a_x + b_y

This is one equation for the two unknown functions a_x, b_y. We have a 
again some freedom of choice and use it to set b_y = 0 which determines our
integration constants as:

  a_x = h + f^z_x + g^z_y
  b_y = 0

Integrating a_x with respect to x and b_y with respect to y gives our desired
functions:

  a = a(x,y) = a_x^x = (h + f^z_x + g^z_y)^x
  b = b(x,y) = b_y^y = 0^y = c(x)

where c(x) can be function of x but for simplicity, we can also set it to zero.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other choices:

We may want the divergence of F,G,H to be zero. In this case, we have the 
additional equation:

  F_x + G_y + H_z = 0

hmm...if we keep using H = const, we would have H_z = 0, so F_x = -G_y, so:

  h = G_x - F_y = 2*G_x      edit:...wait..no! that would require F_y = -G_x

Maybe, together with the equation from earlier:

  G = -f^z + a(x,y)
  
we could find a different way to determine a(x,y)? Like

  G = -f^z + a(x,y) = (h/2)^x
  
This needs to be tested...

Or - maybe to obtain a divergence-free solution, we can proceed as before and then add an 
appropriate (curl-free?) field to our found solution? Maybe we should compute the divergence of the
found vector potential and find a curl-free vector field that has as divergence the negative of 
that and add it to cancel the divergence?

There, they do not only assume H(x,y,z) = const but even simpler H(x,y,z) = 0.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What about writing the given vector field as v = (v1, v2, v3), the desired vector potential as 
w = (w1, w2, w3), the partial differential operators with respect to x,y,z as dx,dy,dz. Then the 
system of equations to solve looks like:

  dy w3 - dz w2 = v1, dz w1 - dx w3 = v2, dx w2 - dy w1 = v3
  
and we can write this as a matrix equation with a matrix containing the operators dx,dy,dz as:

  [ 0  -dz  dy] [w1]   [v1]
  [ dz  0  -dx] [w2] = [v2]
  [-dy  dx  0 ] [w3]   [v3]
  
and apply the Gaussian elimination algo to that? We would have to interpret the product of two 
operators as applying one after the other and the "division" by an operator as applying the inverse,
i.e. something like dz/dy would mean: differentiate with respect to z and integrate with respect to 
y. But I'm afraid, the matrix is singular and therefore admits infinitely many solutions. But maybe
we can incorporate other conditions like div = 0 as additional rows like so:

  [ 0  -dz  dy] [w1]   [v1]
  [ dz  0  -dx] [w2] = [v2]
  [-dy  dx  0 ] [w3]   [v3]
  [ dx  dy  dz]        [0 ]
