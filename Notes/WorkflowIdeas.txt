Using AI assistance:

- Describe an algorithm in plain English in a very detailed way. Mayb create a .txt or .md document
  for that purpose. Direct the AI to the textual description and aks it to translate that it into 
  prototype code that is optimized for readability - not for computational efficiency. Then do
  exhaustive unit tests with this prototype - maybe let the test cases also be AI generated. If all 
  works fine, ask the AI to create an efficienty optimized version of the code. Implenent unit tests
  for that version, too - check the outputs against thoses generated by the previously created 
  prototype.

- Implement a algorithm or perform a computation for a small example problem and ask the AI to 
  extrapolate to the general case and generate a pseudo-code representation and actual code for it.
  
- Maybe when creating a prototype implementation of a particular idea, do that in a separate file
  or pair of .h/.cpp files so the AI can be pointed to these files and consume them with being 
  distract by other stuff. Currently, I have a lot of prototype implementations in a single file.
  That's fine for me working on them but for effective AI assistance, it may be a distraction.
  
  
  
ToDo:

- Maybe try the "implement algo for small example, let AI generalize" workflow with the idea for a
  transparent upsampling -> downsampling roundtrip. Maybe try it with Claude and ChatGPT 4 Pro. 
  Sabine Hossenfelder said that the latter is the best at math stuff. ...but I'm afraid, it requires
