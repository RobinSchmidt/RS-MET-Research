This project is meant to demonstrate and experiment with various C++ constructs, idioms and design 
patterns for copy/paste/edit into actual production code. It can serve as quick reference to look 
up the syntax for a certain construct and a place to grab the code from.

todo:
function pointers, lambdas, std::function, initializers, etc.
