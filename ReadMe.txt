This repo contains prototypes, experiments, collected information, code snippets and libraries from 
various sources for research and devlopment. It's my main playground to try out new ideas which may 
or may not at some point be moved over into the main RS-MET repo depending on if and when I consider 
them generally useful and mature enough. This includes experimental signal processing algorithms but 
also stuff that I do in a more recreational mode such as mathematical art rendering and image 
processing functions that I write just for fun. It contains also code where I familiarize myself 
with new mathematical or algorithmic ideas or try out some of my own ideas. It's a bit messy here in 
this repo because this is the place where I just mess around with ideas and hobby projects.

In order to build the C++ projects, the main RS-MET repo must sit locally in the same folder as this
RS-MET-Research repo. If it still doesn't work, it might be the case that RS-MET repo has to be 
switched to a more recently updated branch. The most up to dat branch there is always the "work" 
branch.
