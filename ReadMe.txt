In order to build the C++ projects, the main RS-MET repo must sit locally in the same folder as this
RS-MET-Research repo. If it still doesn't work, it might be the case that RS-MET repo has to be 
switched to a more recently updated branch. The most up to dat branch there is always the "work" 
branch.
