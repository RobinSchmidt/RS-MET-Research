The secondary repos like RS-MET-Research, RS-MET-Tests, etc. should use the same branch structure as
the main RS-MET repo. We should avoid situations in which, say, a master branch of the Research repo 
depends on code in the develop or work branch of the main repo. 

(That's currently the case -> fix that)
